<h2>PROLOGUE.</h2>
</div>

<p>&#8220;That girl the murderer of a man&mdash;of Lee Holly! That
pretty little girl? Bosh! I don&#8217;t believe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not say she killed him; I said she was suspected.
And even though she was cleared, the death of that renegade
adds one more to the mysteries of our new West.
But I think the mere suspicion that she did it entitles her
to a medal, or an ovation of some sort.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speakers were two men in complete hunting costume.
That they were strangers in the Northwest was
evidenced by the very lively interest they took in each
bit of local color in landscape or native humanity. Of
the latter, there was a most picturesque variety. There
were the Northern red men in their bright blankets, and
women, too, with their beadwork and tanned skins for
sale. A good market-place for these was this spot where
the Kootenai River is touched by the iron road that drives
from the lakes to the Pacific. The road runs along our
Northern boundary so close that it is called the &#8220;Great
Northern,&#8221; and verily the land it touches is great in its
wildness and its beauty.</p>
<p>The two men, with their trophies of elk-horn and beaver
paws, with their scarred outfit and a general air of elation
gained from a successful &#8220;outing,&#8221; tramped down to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
little station after a last lingering view toward far hunting
grounds. While waiting for the train bound eastward,
they employed their time in dickering with the Indian
moccasin-makers, of whom they bought arrows and gaily
painted bows of ash, with which to deck the wall of some
far-away city home.</p>
<p>While thus engaged, a little fleet of canoes was sighted
skimming down the river from that greater wilderness of
the North, penetrated at that time only by the prospector,
or a chance hunter; for the wealth of gold in those
high valleys had not yet been more than hinted at, and
the hint had not reached the ears of the world.</p>
<p>Even the Indians were aroused from their lethargy,
and watched with keen curiosity the approaching canoes.
When from the largest there stepped forth a young girl&mdash;a
rather remarkable-looking young girl&mdash;there was a
name spoken by a tall Indian boatman, who stood near
the two strangers. The Indians nodded their heads, and
the name was passed from one to the other&mdash;the name
&#8217;Tana&mdash;a soft, musical name as they pronounced it. One
of the strangers, hearing it, turned quickly to a white
ranchman, who had a ferry at that turn of the river, and
asked if that was the young girl who had helped locate
the new gold find at the Twin Springs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely,&#8221; agreed the ranchman. &#8220;Word came that
she was to cut the diggings and go to school a spell. A
Mr. Haydon, who represents a company that&#8217;s to work
the mine, sent down word that a special party was to go
East over the road from here to-day; so I guess she&#8217;s one
of the specials. She came near going on a special to the
New Jerusalem, she did, not many days ago. I reckon
you folks heard how Lee Holly&mdash;toughest man in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
length of the Columbia&mdash;was wiped off the living earth
by her last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We heard she was cleared of it,&#8221; assented the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, so she was, so she was&mdash;cleared by an alibi,
sworn to by Dan Overton. You don&#8217;t know Dan, I suppose?
Squarest man you ever met! And he don&#8217;t have to
scratch gravel any more, either, for he has a third interest
in that Twin Spring find, and it pans out big. They say
the girl sold her share for two hundred thousand. She
doesn&#8217;t look top-heavy over it, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she did not. She walked between two men&mdash;one a
short, rather pompous elderly man, who bore a slight resemblance
to her, and whom she treated rather coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I am not tired,&#8221; she said, in a strong, musical
voice. &#8220;I have been brought all the way on cushions,
so how could I be? Why, I have gone alone in a canoe
on a longer trail than we floated over, and I think I will
again some day. Max, there is one thing I want in this
world, and want bad; that is, to get Mr. Haydon out on
a trip where we can&#8217;t eat until we kill and cook our
dinner. He doesn&#8217;t know anything about real comfort;
he wants too many cushions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man she called Max bent his head and whispered
something to her, at which her face flushed just a little
and a tiny wrinkle crept between her straight, beautiful
brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you not to say pretty things that way, just because
you think girls like to hear them. I don&#8217;t. Maybe
I will when I get civilized; but Mr. Haydon thinks that is
a long ways ahead, doesn&#8217;t he?&#8221; The wrinkle was gone&mdash;vanished
in a quizzical smile, as she looked up into the
very handsome face of the young fellow.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; he acknowledged. &#8220;I have a strong desire,
especially when you snub me, to be the man to take you
on a lone trail like that. I will, too, some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you will,&#8221; she agreed. &#8220;But I feel sorry for
you beforehand.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed a tantalizing specimen of girlhood, as she
stood there, a slight, brown slip of a thing, dressed in a
plain flannel suit, the color of her golden-brown short
curls. In her brown cloth hat the wings of a redbird
gleamed&mdash;the feathers and her lips having all there was
of bright color about her; for her face was singularly
colorless for so young a girl. The creamy skin suggested
a pale-tinted blossom, but not a fragile one; and the eyes&mdash;full
eyes of wine-brown&mdash;looked out with frank daring
on the world.</p>
<p>But for all the daring brightness of her glances, it was
not a joyous face, such as one would wish a girl of seventeen
to possess. A little cynical curve of the red mouth, a
little contemptuous glance from those brown eyes, showed
one that she took her measurements of individuals
by a gauge of her own, and that she had not that guileless
trust in human nature that is supposed to belong to
young womanhood. The full expression indicated an independence
that seemed a breath caught from the wild
beauty of those Northern hills.</p>
<p>Her gaze rested lightly on the two strangers and their
trophies of the chase, on the careless ferryman, and the
few stragglers from the ranch and the cabins. These
last had gathered there to view the train and its people
as they passed, for the ties on which the iron rails rested
were still of green wood, and the iron engines of transportation
were recent additions to those lands of the far
North, and were yet a novelty.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>Over the faces of the white men her eyes passed carelessly.
She did not seem much interested in civilized
men, even though decked in finer raiment than was usual
in that locality; and, after a cool glance at them all, she
walked directly past them and spoke to the tall Indian
who had first uttered her name to the others.</p>
<p>His face brightened when she addressed him; but their
words were low, as are ever the words of an Indian
in converse, low and softly modulated; and the girl did
not laugh in the face of the native as she had when the
handsome young white man had spoken to her in softened
tones.</p>
<p>The two sportsmen gave quickened attention to her as
they perceived she was addressing the Indian in his own
language. Many gestures of her slim brown hands aided
her speech, and as he watched her face, one of the sportsmen
uttered the impulsive exclamation at the beginning
of this story. It seemed past belief that she could have
committed the deed with which her name had been connected,
and of which the Kootenai valley had heard a
great deal during the week just passed. That it had become
the one topic of general interest in the community
was due partly to the personality of the girl, and partly
to the fact that the murdered man had been one of the
most notorious in all that wild land extending north and
west into British Columbia.</p>
<p>Looking at the frank face of the girl and hearing her
musical, decided tones, the man had a reasonable warrant
for deciding that she was not guilty.</p>
<p>&#8220;She is one of the most strongly interesting girls of
her age I have ever seen,&#8221; he decided. &#8220;Girls of that age
generally lack character. She does not; it impresses itself
on a man though she never speak a word to him. Wish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
she&#8217;d favor me with as much of her attention as she gives
that hulking redskin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a &#8217;case,&#8217; isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked his friend. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be
wanting to use her as a centerpiece for your next novel;
but you can&#8217;t make an orthodox heroine of her, for
there must have been some reason for the suspicion that
she helped him &#8217;over the range,&#8217; as they say out here.
There must have been something socially and morally
wrong about the fact that he was found dead in her cabin.
No, Harvey; you&#8217;d better write up the inert, inoffensive
red man on his native heath, and let this remarkable young
lady enjoy her thousands in modest content&mdash;if the ghosts
let her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said the other man, with a sort of impatience.
&#8220;You jump too quickly to the conclusion that
there must be wrong where there is suspicion. But you
have put an idea into my mind as to the story. If I can
ever learn the whole history of this affair, I will make use
of it, and I&#8217;m not afraid of finding my pretty girl in the
wrong, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew from the moment we heard who she was that
your impressionable nature would fall a victim, but you
can&#8217;t write a story of her alone; you will want your hero
and one or two other people. I suppose, now, that very
handsome young fellow with the fastidious get-up will
about suit you for the hero. He does look rather lover-like
when he addresses your girl with the history. Will
you pair them off?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will let you know a year from now,&#8221; returned the
man called Harvey. &#8220;But just now I am going to pay my
respects to the very well-fed looking elderly gentleman.
He seems to be the chaperon of the party. I have acquired
a taste for trailing things during our thirty days hunt in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
these hills, and I&#8217;m going to trail this trio, with the expectation
of bagging a romance.&#8221;</p>
<p>His friend watched him approach the elder gentleman,
and was obviously doubtful of the reception he would get,
for the portly, prosperous-looking individual did not seem
to have been educated in that generous Western atmosphere,
where a man is a brother if he acts square and
speaks fair. Conservatism was stamped in the deep
corners of his small mouth, on the clean-shaven lips, and
the correctly cut side-whiskers that added width to his
fat face.</p>
<p>But the journalist proper, the world over, is ever a bit
of a diplomat. He has won victories over so many conservative
things, and is daunted by few. When Harvey
found himself confronted by a monocle through which he
was coolly surveyed, it did not disturb him in the least
(beyond making it difficult to retain a grave demeanor
at the lively interest shown by the Indians in that fashionable
toy).</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir&mdash;yes, sir; I am T. J. Haydon, of Philadelphia,&#8221;
acknowledged he of the glass disc, &#8220;but I don&#8217;t
know you, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be pleased to remedy that if you will allow me,&#8221;
returned the other, suavely, producing a card which he
offered for examination. &#8220;You are, no doubt, acquainted
with the syndicate I represent, even if my name tells you
nothing. I have been hunting here with a friend for a
month, and intend writing up the resources of this district.
I have a letter of introduction to your partner,
Mr. Seldon, but did not follow the river so far as to
reach your works, though I&#8217;ve heard a good deal about
them, and imagine them interesting.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; very interesting&mdash;very interesting from
a sportsman&#8217;s or mineralogist&#8217;s point of view,&#8221; agreed the
older man, as he twirled the card in a disturbed, uncertain
way. &#8220;Do you travel East, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Harvey? Yes?
Well, let me introduce Mr. Seldon&#8217;s nephew&mdash;he&#8217;s a New
Yorker&mdash;Max Lyster. Wait a minute and I&#8217;ll get him
away from those beastly Indians. I never can understand
the attraction they have for the average tourist.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when he reached Lyster he said not a word of
the despised reds; he had other matters more important.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here, Max! A most annoying thing has happened,&#8221;
he said, hurriedly. &#8220;Those two men are newspaper fellows,
and one is going East on our train. Worse still&mdash;the
one knows people I know. Gad! I&#8217;d rather lose a
thousand dollars than meet them now! And you must
come over and get acquainted. They&#8217;ve been here
a month, and are to write accounts of the life and
country. That means they have been here long enough
to hear all about &#8217;Tana and that Holly. Do you understand?
You&#8217;ll have to treat them well,&mdash;the best possible&mdash;pull
wires even if it costs money, and fix it so that a
record of this does not get into the Eastern papers. And,
above and beyond everything else, so long as we are in
this depraved corner of the country, you must keep them
from noticing that girl Montana.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man looked across at the girl, and smiled
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to undertake any possible thing for you,&#8221;
he said; &#8220;but, my dear sir, to keep people from noticing
&#8217;Tana is one of the things beyond my power. And if she
gives notice to all the men who will notice her, I&#8217;ve an idea
jealousy will turn my hair gray early. But come on and
introduce your man, and don&#8217;t get in a fever over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
meeting. I am so fortunate as to know more of the
journalistic fraternity than you, and I happen to be aware
that they are generally gentlemen. Therefore, you&#8217;d better
not drop any hints to them of monetary advantages in
exchange for silence unless you want to be beautifully
roasted by a process only possible in printer&#8217;s ink.&#8221;</p>
<p>The older man uttered an exclamation of impatience,
as he led his young companion over to the sportsmen, who
had joined each other again; and as he effected the introduction,
his mind was sorely upset by dread of the two
gentlemanly strangers and &#8217;Tana.</p>
<p>&#8217;Tana was most shamelessly continuing her confidences
with the tall Indian, despite the fact that she knew it was
a decided annoyance to her principal escort. Altogether
the evening was a trying one to Mr. T. J. Haydon.</p>
<p>The sun had passed far to the west, and the shadows
were growing longer under the hills there by the river.
Clear, red glints fell across the cool ripples of the water,
and slight chill breaths drifted down the ravines and told
that the death of summer was approaching.</p>
<p>Some sense of the beauty of the dying October day
seemed to touch the girl, for she walked a little apart and
picked a spray of scarlet maple leaves and looked from
them to the hills and the beautiful valley, where the red
and the yellow were beginning to crowd out the greens.
Yes, the summer was dying&mdash;dying! Other summers
would come in their turn, but none quite the same. The
girl showed all the feeling of its loss in her face. In her
eyes the quick tears came, as she looked at the mountains.
The summer was dying; it was autumn&#8217;s colors she held
in her hand, and she shivered, though she stood in the
sunshine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span></p>
<p>As she turned toward the group again, she met the
eyes of the stranger to whom Max was talking. He
seemed to have been watching her with a great deal of
interest, and her hand was raised to her eyes, lest a trace
of tears should prove food for curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was to one of Akkomi&#8217;s relations I was talking,&#8221;
she remarked to Mr. Haydon, when he questioned her.
&#8220;His little grandson is sick, and I would like to send him
something. I haven&#8217;t money enough in my pocket, and
wish you would get me some.&#8221;</p>
<p>After taking some money out of his purse for her,
he eyed the tall savage with disfavor.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll buy bad whisky with it,&#8221; he grumbled.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he will not,&#8221; contradicted the girl. &#8220;If a person
treats these Indians square, he can trust them. But if
a lie is told them, or a promise broken&mdash;well, they get
even by tricking you if they can, and I can&#8217;t say that I
blame them. But they won&#8217;t trick me, so don&#8217;t worry;
and I&#8217;m as sure the things will go to that little fellow
safely as though I took them.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was giving the money and some directions to the
Indian, when a word from a squaw drew her attention to
the river.</p>
<p>A canoe had just turned the bend not a quarter of a
mile away, and was skimming the water with the swiftness
of a swallow&#8217;s dart. Only one man was in it, and he
was coming straight for the landing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some miner rushing down to see the train go by,&#8221;
remarked Mr. Haydon; but the girl did not answer. Her
face grew even more pale, and her hands clasped each
other nervously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the Indian beside her, and nodded to her
assuringly. Then the color swept upward over her face
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
as she met his kindly glance, and drawing herself a little
straighter, she walked indifferently away.</p>
<p>The stolid red man did not look at all snubbed; he only
pocketed the money she had given him, and looked after
her with a slight smile, accented more by the deepening
wrinkles around his black eyes than by any change about
the lips.</p>
<p>Then there was a low rumbling sound borne on the
air, and as the muffled whistle of the unseen train came to
them from the wilderness to the west, with one accord the
Indians turned their attention to their wares, and the
white people to their baggage. When the train slowed up
Mr. Haydon, barely waiting for the last revolution of the
wheels, energetically hastened the young girl up the
steps of the car nearest them.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the hurry?&#8221; she asked, with a slight impatience.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think,&#8221; he replied quickly, &#8220;there is but a short
stop made at this station, and as there are several vacant
seats in this car, please occupy one of them until I have
seen the conductor. There may be some changes made
as to the compartments engaged for us. Until that is
decided, will you be so kind as to remain in this coach?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded rather indifferently, and looked around for
Max. He was gathering up some robes and satchels when
the older man joined him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not going to make the trip to Chicago in the
car with those fellows if it can be helped, Max,&#8221; he insisted,
fussily; &#8220;we&#8217;ll wait and see what car they are
booked for, and I&#8217;ll arrange for another. Sorry I did
not get a special, as I first intended.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But see here; they are first-class fellows&mdash;worth one&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
while to meet,&#8221; protested Max; but the other shook his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look after the baggage while I see the conductor.
&#8217;Tana is in one of the cars&mdash;don&#8217;t know which. We&#8217;ll
go for her when we get settled. Now, don&#8217;t argue. Time
is too precious.&#8221;</p>
<p>And &#8217;Tana! She seated herself rather sulkily, as she
was told, and looked at once toward the river.</p>
<p>The canoe was landing, and the man jumped to the
shore. With quick, determined strides, he came across
the land to the train. She tried to follow him with her
eyes, but he crossed to the other side of the track.</p>
<p>There was rather a boisterous party in the car&mdash;two
men and two women. One of the latter, a flaxen-haired,
petite creature, was flitting from one side of the car to
the other, making remarks about the Indians, admiring
particularly one boy&#8217;s beaded dress, and garnishing her
remarks with a good deal of slang.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Chub! that boy&#8217;s suit would be a great &#8217;make-up&#8217;
for me in that new turn&mdash;the jig, you know; new, too.
There isn&#8217;t a song-and-dance on the boards done with
Indian make-up. Knock them silly in the East, where
they don&#8217;t see reds. Now sing out, and tell me if it
wouldn&#8217;t make a hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, Goldie, give us a rest on shop talk,&#8221; growled the
gentleman called Chub. &#8220;If you&#8217;d put a little more ginger
into the good specialty you have, instead of depending
on wardrobe, you&#8217;d hit &#8217;em hard enough. It ain&#8217;t plans
that count, girlie&mdash;it&#8217;s work.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;girlie&#8221; addressed accepted the criticism with easy
indifference, and her fair, dissipated face was only twisted
in a grimace, while she held one hand aloft and jingled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
the bangles on her bracelets as though poising a tambourine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better hustle yourself into the smoker again, Chubby
dear. It will take a half-dozen more cigars to put you in
your usual sweet frame of mind. Run along now. Ta-ta!&#8221;</p>
<p>The other woman seemed to think their remarks very
witty, especially when Chub really did arise and make his
way toward the smoker. Goldie then went back to the
window, where the Indians were to be seen. The quartet
were, to judge by their own frank remarks, a party of
variety singers and dancers who had been doing the Pacific
circuit, and were now booked for some Eastern
houses, of which they spoke as &#8220;solid.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of the passengers had got out and were buying
little things from the Indians, as souvenirs of the country.
&#8217;Tana saw Mr. Haydon among them, in earnest conversation
with the conductor; saw Max, with his hand full
of satchels, suddenly reach out the other hand with a
great deal of heartiness and meet the man of the canoe.</p>
<p>He was not so handsome a man as Max, yet would
have been noticeable anywhere&mdash;tall, olive-skinned, and
dark-haired. His dress had not the fashionable cut of
the young fellow he spoke to. But he wore his buckskin
jacket with a grace that bespoke physical strength and
independence; and when he pushed his broad-brimmed
gray hat back from his face, he showed a pair of dark
eyes that had a very direct glance. They were serious,
contemplative eyes, that to some might look even moody.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a fellow with a great figure,&#8221; remarked the
other woman of the quartet; &#8220;that fellow with the sombrero;
built right up from the ground, and looks like a
picture; don&#8217;t he, Charlie?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t see him,&#8221; complained Goldie, &#8220;but suppose it&#8217;s
one of the ranchmen who live about here.&#8221; Then she
turned and donated a brief survey to &#8217;Tana. &#8220;Do you live
in this region?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>After a deliberate, contemptuous glance from the questioner&#8217;s
frizzed head to her little feet, &#8217;Tana answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;No; do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>With this curt reply, she turned her shoulder very
coolly on the searcher for information.</p>
<p>Vexation sent the angry blood up into the little woman&#8217;s
face. She looked as though about to retort, when a gentleman
who had just taken possession of a compartment,
and noted all that had passed, came forward and addressed
our heroine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until your friends come in, will you not take my seat?&#8221;
he asked, courteously. &#8220;I will gladly make the exchange,
or go for Mr. Lyster or Mr. Haydon, if you desire it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you; I will take your seat,&#8221; she agreed. &#8220;It is
good of you to offer it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, folks, I&#8217;m going outside to take in this free Wild
West show,&#8221; called the variety actress to her companions.
&#8220;Come along?&#8221;</p>
<p>But they declined. She had reached the platform alone,
when, coming toward the car, she saw the man of the
sombrero, and shrank back with a gasp of utter dismay.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, good Heaven!&#8221; she muttered, and all the color
and bravado were gone from her face, as she shrank back
out of his range of vision and almost into the arms of
the man Harvey, who had given the other girl his seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up?&#8221; he asked, bluntly.</p>
<p>She only gave a muttered, unintelligible reply, pushed
past him to her own seat, where her feather-laden hat
was donned with astonishing rapidity, a great cloak was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
thrown around her, and she sank into a corner, a huddled
mass of wraps and feathers. Any one could have walked
along the aisle without catching even a glimpse of her
flaxen hair.</p>
<p>&#8217;Tana and the stranger exchanged looks of utter wonder
at the lightning change effected before their eyes.</p>
<p>At that moment a tap-tap sounded on the window beside
&#8217;Tana, and, looking around, she met the dark eyes
of the man with the sombrero gazing kindly upward at
her.</p>
<p>The people were getting aboard the train again&mdash;the
time was so short&mdash;so short! and how can one speak
through a double glass? The fingers were all unequal to
the fastening of the window, and she turned an imploring,
flushed face to the helpful stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you&mdash;oh, will you, please?&#8221; she asked, breathlessly.
&#8220;Thank you, I&#8217;m very much obliged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the window was raised, and her hand thrust out
to the man, who was bareheaded now, and who looked
very much as though he held the wealth of the world
when he clasped only &#8217;Tana&#8217;s fingers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it is you, is it?&#8221; she asked, with a rather lame attempt
at careless speech. &#8220;I thought you had forgotten
to say good-by to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You knew better,&#8221; he contradicted. &#8220;You knew&mdash;you
know now it wasn&#8217;t because I forgot.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her moodily from under his dark brows,
and noticed the color flutter over her cheek and throat
in an adorable way. She had drawn her hand from him,
and it rested on the window&mdash;a slim brown hand, with a
curious ring on one finger&mdash;two tiny snakes whose
jeweled heads formed the central point of attraction.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You said you would not wear that again. If it&#8217;s a
hoodoo, as you thought, why not throw it away?&#8221; he
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I&#8217;ve changed my mind. I need to wear it so that
I will be reminded of something&mdash;something important as
a hoodoo,&#8221; she said, with a strange, bitter smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it back to me, &#8217;Tana,&#8221; he urged. &#8220;I will&mdash;No&mdash;Max
will have something much prettier for you. And
listen, my girl. You are going away; don&#8217;t ever come
back; forget everything here but the money that will be
yours for the claim. Do you understand me? Forget all
I said to you when&mdash;you know. I had no right to say it;
I must have been drunk. I&mdash;I lied, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you lied, did you?&#8221; she asked, cynically, and her
hands were clasped closely, so close the ring must have
hurt her. He noticed it, and kept his eyes on her hand
as he continued, doggedly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. You see, little girl, I thought I&#8217;d own up before
you left, so you wouldn&#8217;t be wasting any good time in
being sorry about the folks back here. It wasn&#8217;t square
for me to trouble you as I did. And&mdash;I lied. I came
down to say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t have troubled yourself,&#8221; she said, curtly.
&#8220;But I see you can tell lies. I never would have believed
it if I hadn&#8217;t heard you. But I guess, after all, I will
give you the ring. You might want it to give to some
one else&mdash;perhaps your wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bell was ringing and the wheels began slowly to
revolve. She pulled the circlet from her finger and almost
flung it at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana!&#8221; and all of keen appeal was in his voice
and his eyes, &#8220;little girl&mdash;good-by!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>But she turned away her head. Her hand, however,
reached out and the spray of autumn leaves fluttered to
his feet where the ring lay.</p>
<p>Then the rumble of the moving train sounded through
the valley, and the girl turned to find Max, Mr. Haydon
and a porter approaching, to convey her to the car ahead.
Mr. Haydon&#8217;s face was a study of dismay at the sight of
Mr. Harvey closing the window and showing evident interest
in &#8217;Tana&#8217;s comfort.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Dan did get down to see you off, &#8217;Tana?&#8221; observed
Max, as he led her along the aisle. &#8220;Dear old fellow!
how I did try to coax him into coming East later; but it
was of no use. He gave me some flowers for you&mdash;wild
beauties. He never seemed to say much, &#8217;Tana, but I&#8217;ve
an idea you&#8217;ll never have a better friend in your life
than that same old Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey watched their exit, and smiled a little concerning
Mr. Haydon&#8217;s evident annoyance. He watched,
also, the flaxen-haired bundle in the corner, and saw the
curious, malignant look with which she followed &#8217;Tana,
and to his friend he laughed over his triumph in exchanging
speech with the pretty, peculiar girl in brown.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the old party looked terribly fussy over it. In
fact, I&#8217;ve about sifted out the reason. He imagines me
a newspaper reporter on the alert for sensations. He&#8217;s
afraid his stupidly respectable self may be mentioned in
a newspaper article concerning this local tragedy they all
talk about. Why, bless his pocket-book! if I ever use pen
and ink on that girl&#8217;s story, it will not be for a newspaper
article.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you intend to tell it?&#8221; asked his friend. &#8220;How
will you learn it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know yet. The &#8217;how&#8217; does not matter; I&#8217;ll
tell you on paper some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And write up that handsome Lyster as the hero?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then a bend of the road brought them again in sight
of the river of the Kootenais. Here and there the canoes
of the Indians were speeding across at the ferry. But
one canoe alone was moving north; not very swiftly, but
almost as though drifting with the current.</p>
<p>Using his field-glass, Harvey found it was as he had
thought. The occupant of the solitary canoe was the tall
man whose dark face had impressed the theatrical lady
so strongly. He was not using the paddle, and his chin
was resting on one clenched hand, while in the other he
held something to which he was giving earnest attention.</p>
<p>It was a spray of bright-colored leaves, and the
watcher dropped his glass with a guilty feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;He brings her flowers, and gets in return only dead
leaves,&#8221; Harvey thought, grimly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t hear a word
he said to her; but his eyes spoke strongly enough, poor
devil! I wonder if she sees him, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>And all through the evening, and for many a day, the
picture remained in his mind. Even when he wrote the
story that is told in these pages, he could never find words
to express the utter loneliness of that life, as it seemed to
drift away past the sun-touched ripples of water into that
vast, shadowy wilderness to the north.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>
<h3>A STRANGE GIRL.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well, by the help of either her red gods or devils, she
can swim, anyway!&#8221;</p>
<p>This explosive statement was made one June morning
on the banks of the Kootenai, and the speaker, after a
steady gaze, relinquished his field-glass to the man beside
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can she make it?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>A grunt was the only reply given him. The silent
watcher was too much interested in the scene across the
water.</p>
<p>Shouts came to them&mdash;the yells of frightened Indian
children; and from the cone-shaped dwellings, up from
the water, the Indian women were hurrying. One, reaching
the shore first, sent up a shrill cry, as she perceived
that, from the canoe where the children played, one had
fallen over, and was being swept away by that swift-rushing,
chill water, far out from the reaching hands of
the others.</p>
<p>Then a figure lolling on the shore farther down stream
than the canoe sprang erect at the frightened scream.</p>
<p>One quick glance showed the helplessness of those
above, and another the struggling little form there in the
water&mdash;the little one who turned such wild eyes toward
the shore, and was the only one of them all who was
not making some outcry.</p>
<p>The white men, who were watching from the opposite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
side, could see shoes flung aside quickly; a jacket dropped
on the shore; and then down into the water a slight
figure darted with the swiftness of a kingfisher, and
swam out to the little fellow who had struggled to keep
his head above water, but was fast growing helpless in the
chill of the mountain river.</p>
<p>Then it was that Mr. Maxwell Lyster commented on
the physical help lent by the gods of the red people, as the
ability of any female to swim thus lustily in spite of that
icy current seemed to his civilized understanding a thing
superhuman. Of course, bears and other animals of the
woods swam it at all seasons, when it was open; but to
see a woman dash into it like that! Well, it sent a shiver
over him to think of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll both get chilled and drop to the bottom!&#8221; he
remarked, with irritated concern. &#8220;Of course there are
enough of the red vagabonds in this new El Dorado of
yours, without that particular squaw. But it would be a
pity that so plucky a one should be translated.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then a yell of triumph came from the other shore. A
canoe had been loosened, and was fairly flying over the
water to where the child had been dragged to the surface,
and the rescuer was holding herself up by the slow
efforts of one arm, but could make no progress with her
burden.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no squaw!&#8221; commented the other man, who
had been looking through the glass.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Dan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no squaw, I tell you,&#8221; insisted the other, with the
superior knowledge of a native. &#8220;Thought so the minute
I saw her drop the shoes and jacket that way. She didn&#8217;t
make a single Indian move. It&#8217;s a white woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Queer place for a white woman, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>The man called Dan did not answer. The canoe had
reached that figure in the water and the squaw in it lifted
the now senseless child and laid him in the bottom of the
light craft.</p>
<p>A slight altercation seemed going on between the
woman in the water and the one in the boat. The former
was protesting against being helped on board&mdash;the men
could see that by their gestures. She finally gained her
point, for the squaw seized the paddle and sent the boat
shoreward with all the strength of her brown arms, while
the one in the water held on to the canoe and was thus
towed back, where half the Indian village had now
swarmed to receive them.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s got sand and sense,&#8221; and Dan nodded his appreciation
of the towing process; &#8220;for, chilled as she must
be, the canoe would more than likely have turned over if
she had tried to climb into it. Look at the pow-wow they
are kicking up! That little red devil must count for big
stakes with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the woman who swam after him. See! they try
to stand her on her feet, but she can&#8217;t walk. There!
she&#8217;s on the ground again. I&#8217;d give half my supper to
know if she has killed herself with that ice-bath.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you can eat all your supper and find out, too,&#8221;
observed the other, with a shrug of his shoulders, and a
quizzical glance at his companion, &#8220;unless even the
glimpse of a petticoat has chased away your appetite.
You had better take some advice from an old man, Max,
and swear off approaching females in this country, for
the specimens you&#8217;ll find here aren&#8217;t things to make you
proud they&#8217;re human.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An old man!&#8221; repeated Mr. Lyster with a smile of
derision. &#8220;You must be pretty near twenty-eight years
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
old&mdash;aren&#8217;t you, Dan? and just about five years older
than myself. And what airs you do assume in consequence!
With all the weight of those years,&#8221; he added,
slowly, &#8220;I doubt, Mr. Dan Overton, if you have really
<i>lived</i> as much as I have.&#8221;</p>
<p>One glance of the dark eyes was turned on the speaker
for an instant, and then the old felt hat again shaded
them as he continued watching the group on the far shore.
The swimmer had been picked up by a stalwart Indian
woman, and was carried bodily up to one of the lodges,
while another squaw&mdash;evidently the mother&mdash;carried the
little redskin who had caused all the commotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose, by living, you mean the life of settlements&mdash;or,
to condense the question still more, the life of
cities,&#8221; continued Overton, stretching himself lazily on the
bank. &#8220;You mean the life of a certain set in one certain
city&mdash;New York, for instance,&#8221; and he grinned at the expression
of impatience on the face of the other. &#8220;Yes, I
reckon New York is about the one, and a certain part of
the town to live in. A certain gang of partners, who have
a certain man to make their clothes and boots and hats,
and stamp his name on the inside of them, so that other
folks can see, when you take off your coat, or your hat, or
your gloves, that they were made at just the right place.
This makes you a man worth knowing&mdash;isn&#8217;t that about
the idea? And in the afternoon, at just about the right
hour, you rig yourself out in a certain cut of coat, and
stroll for an hour or so on a certain street! In the evening&mdash;if
a man wants to understand just what it is to live&mdash;he
must get into other clothes and drop into the theater,
making a point of being introduced to any heavy swell
within reach, so you can speak of it afterward, you know.
Just as your chums like to say they had a supper with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
pretty actress, after the curtain went down; but they don&#8217;t
go into details, and own up that the &#8217;actress&#8217; maybe never
did anything on a stage but walk on in armor and carry a
banner. Oh, scowl if you want to! Of course it sounds
shoddy when a trapper outlines it; but it doesn&#8217;t seem
shoddy to the people who live like that. Then, about the
time that all good girls are asleep, it is just the hour for
a supper to be ordered, at just the right place for the wine
to be good, and the dishes served in A1 shape, with a
convenient waiter who knows how dim to make the
lights, and how to efface himself, and let you wait on your
&#8217;lady&#8217; with your own hands. And she&#8217;ll go home wearing
a ring of yours&mdash;two, if you have them; and you&#8217;ll wake
up at noon next day, and think what a jolly time you
had, but with your head so muddled that you can&#8217;t remember
where it was you were to meet her the next night,
or whether it was the next night that her husband was to
be home, and she couldn&#8217;t see you at all.&#8221; Overton rolled
over on his face and grunted disdainfully, saying: &#8220;That&#8217;s
about the style of thing you call <i>living</i>, don&#8217;t you, sonny?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott, Dan!&#8221; and the &#8220;sonny&#8221; addressed stared
at him in perplexity, &#8220;one never knows what to expect
of you. Of course there is <i>some</i> truth in the sketch you
make; but&mdash;but I thought you had never ranged to the
East?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you? Well, I don&#8217;t look as if I&#8217;d ever ranged
beyond the timber, do I?&#8221; and he stretched out his long
legs with their shabby coverings, and stuck his fingers
through a hole in his hat. &#8220;This outfit doesn&#8217;t look as if
the hands of a Broadway tailor had ever touched it. But,
my boy, the sketch you speak of would be just as true to
life among a certain set in any large city of the States;
only in the West, or even in the South, those ambitious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
sports would know enough to buy a horse on their own
judgment, if they wanted to ride. Or would bet on the
races without hustling around to find some played-out
jockey who would give them tips.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to say the least, your opinion is not very flattering
to us,&#8221; remarked the young man, moodily. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
got some grudge against the East, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Grudge? Not any. And you&#8217;re all right, Max. You
will find thousands willing to keep to your idea of life,
so we won&#8217;t split on that wedge. My old stepdad would
chime in with you if he were here. He prates about
civilization and Eastern culture till I get weary sometimes.
Culture! Wait till you see him. He&#8217;s all right
in his way, of course; but as I cut loose from home when
only fifteen, and never ran across the old man again until
two years ago&mdash;well, you see, I can make my estimates
in that direction without being biased by family feeling.
And I reckon he does the same thing. I don&#8217;t know what
to expect when I go back this time; but, from signs
around camp when I left, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if he
presented me with a stepmother on my return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A stepmother? Whew!&#8221; whistled the other. &#8220;Well,
that shows there are some white women in your region,
anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, we have several. This particular one is a
Pennsylvania product; talks through her nose, and eats
with her knife, and will maybe try to make eyes at you and
keep you in practice. But she is a good, square woman;
simply one of the many specimens that drift out here.
Came up from Helena with the &#8217;boom,&#8217; and started a
milliner store&mdash;a milliner store in the bush, mind you!
But after the Indians had bought all the bright feathers
and artificial flowers, she changed her sign, and keeps an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
eating-house now. It is the high-toned corner of the
camp. She can cook some; and I reckon that&#8217;s what
catches the old man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any more interesting specimens like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not like that,&#8221; returned Overton; &#8220;but there are some
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he arose, and stood listening to sounds back in the
wild forests.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear the &#8217;cayuse&#8217; bell,&#8221; he remarked; &#8220;so the others
are coming. We&#8217;ll go back up to the camp, and, after
&#8217;chuck,&#8217; we&#8217;ll go over and give you a nearer view of
the tribe on the other shore, if you want to add them to
the list of your sight-seeing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I do. They&#8217;ll be a relief after the squads
of railroad section hands we&#8217;ve been having for company
lately. They knocked all the romance out of the wildly
beautiful country we&#8217;ve been coming through since we left
the Columbia River.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come back next year; then a boat will be puffing
up here to the landing, and you can cross to the Columbia
in a few hours, for the road will be completed then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you&mdash;will you be here then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;yes; I reckon so. I never anchor anywhere
very long; but this country suits me, and the company
seems to need me.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young fellow looked at him and laughed, and
dropped his hand on the broad shoulder with a certain
degree of affection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to need you?&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Well, Mr. Dan
Overton, if the day ever comes when <i>I&#8217;m</i> necessary to
the welfare of a section as large as a good-sized State, I
hope I&#8217;ll know enough to appreciate my own importance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope you will,&#8221; said Overton, with a kindly smile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
&#8220;No reason why you should not be of use. Every man
with a fair share of health and strength ought to be of
use somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that sounds all right and is easy to grasp, if you
have been brought up with the idea. But suppose you
had been trained by a couple of maiden aunts who only
thought to give you the manners of a gentleman, and
leave you their money to get through the world with?
I guess, under such circumstances, you, too, might have
settled into the feathery nest prepared for you, and
thought you were doing your duty to the world if you
were only ornamental,&#8221; and the dubious smile on his
really handsome face robbed the speech of any vanity.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, I tell you,&#8221; returned the other. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
growl at yourself so much. You&#8217;ll find your work and
buckle down to it, some of these days. Maybe you&#8217;ll find
it out here&mdash;who knows? Of course Mr. Seldon would
see to it that you got any post you would want in this
district.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s a jolly old fellow, and has shown me a lot
of favors. Seems to me relatives mean more to folks
out here than they do East, because so few have their
families or relatives along, I guess. If it had not been for
Seldon, I rather think I would not have had the chance of
this wild trip with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely not. I don&#8217;t generally want a tenderfoot along
when I&#8217;ve work to do. No offense, Max; but they are
too often a hindrance. Now that you have come, though,
I&#8217;ll confess I&#8217;m glad of it. The lonely trips over this
wild region tend to make a man silent&mdash;a bear among
people when he does reach a camp. But we&#8217;ve talked
most of the time, and I reckon I feel the better of it. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
know I&#8217;ll miss you when I go over this route again.
You&#8217;ll be on your way East by that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The &#8220;cayuse&#8221; bell sounded nearer and nearer, and directly
from the dense forest a packhorse came stepping
with care over the fallen logs, where the sign of a trail
was yet dim to any eyes but those of a woodsman. A bell
at its neck tinkled as it walked, and after it four others
followed, all with heavy loads bound to their backs. It
looked strange to see the patient animals thus walk without
guide or driver through the dense timber of the
mountains; but a little later voices were heard, and two
horsemen came out of the shadows of the wood, and followed
the horses upward along the bank of the river to
where a little stream of fresh water tumbled down to the
Kootenai. There a little camp was located, an insignificant
gathering of tents, but one that meant a promising
event to the country, for it was to be the connecting point
of the boats that would one day float from the States
on the river, and the railroad that would erelong lead
westward over the trail from which the packhorses were
bringing supplies.</p>
<p>The sun was setting and all the ripples of the river
shone red in its reflected light. Forests of pine loomed
up black and shadowy above the shores; and there, higher
up&mdash;up where the snow was, all tips of the river range
were tinged a warm pink, and where the shadows lay, the
lavender and faint purples drifted into each other, and bit
by bit crowded the pink line higher and higher until it
dared touch only the topmost peaks with its lingering
kiss.</p>
<p>Lyster halted to look over the wild beauty of the wilderness,
and from the harmony of river and hills and sky
his eyes turned to Overton.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Dan,&#8221; he said, with an appreciative
smile, a smile that opened his lips and showed how perfect
the mouth was under the brown mustache&mdash;&#8220;you are
right enough to keep close to all these beauties. You seem
in some way to belong to them&mdash;not that you are so
much &#8217;a thing of beauty&#8217; yourself,&#8221; and the smile widened
a little; &#8220;but you have in you all the strength of the
hills and the patience of the wilderness. You know what
I mean.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess so,&#8221; answered Overton. &#8220;You want some
one to spout verses to or make love to, and there is no
subject handy. I can make allowances for you, though.
Those tendencies are apt to stick to a man for about a
year after a trip to Southern California. I don&#8217;t know
whether it&#8217;s the girls down there, or the wine that is accountable
for it; but whatever it is, you have been back
from there only three months. You&#8217;ve three-quarters of
a year to run yet&mdash;maybe more; for I&#8217;ve a notion that
you have a leaning in that direction even in your most
sensible moments.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! You must have made a trip to that wine country
yourself sometime,&#8221; observed Lyster. &#8220;Your theory
suggests practice. Were there girls and wine there then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Plenty,&#8221; returned Overton, briefly. &#8220;Come on. There&#8217;s
the cook shouting supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And after supper we&#8217;re to go over to the Kootenai
camp. Say! what is the meaning of that name, anyway?
You know all their jargons up here; do you know that,
too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody does, I reckon; there are lots of theories flying
around. The generally accepted one is that they were
called the &#8216;<i>Court Nez</i>&#8217; by the French trappers long ago,
and that Kootenai is the result, after generations of Indian
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
pronunciation. They named the &#8216;<i>Nez Perces</i>,&#8217; too&mdash;the
&#8217;pierced noses,&#8217; you know; but that name has kept its
meaning better. You&#8217;ll find the trail of the French all
through the Indian tribes up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think that was a Frenchwoman in the river back
there? You said she was white.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did. But it&#8217;s generally the Frenchmen you
find among the reds, and not the women; though I do
know some square white women across the line who have
married educated Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they are generally a lazy, shiftless set?&#8221;</p>
<p>The tone was half inquiring, and Overton grimaced
and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are not behind the rest, when it comes to a
fight,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;And as to lazy&mdash;well, there are
several colors of people who are that, under some circumstances.
I have an Indian friend across in the States,
who made eight thousand dollars in a cattle deal last year,
and didn&#8217;t sell out, either. Now, when you and I can do
as well on capital we&#8217;ve earned ourselves, then maybe
we&#8217;ll have a right to criticise some of the rest for indolence.
But you can&#8217;t do much to improve Indians,
or any one else, by penning them up in so many square
miles and bribing them to be good. The Indian cattleman
I speak of kept clear of the reservation, and after
drifting around for a while, settled down to the most
natural civilized calling possible to an Indian&mdash;stock-raising.
Dig in the ground? No; they won&#8217;t do much
of that, just at first. But I&#8217;ve eaten some pretty good
garden truck they&#8217;ve raised.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyster whistled and arched his handsome brows significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;So your sympathies run in that direction, do they? Is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
there a Kootenai Pocahontas somewhere in the wilderness
accountable for your ideas? That is about the only
ground I could excuse you on, for I think they are beastly,
except in pictures.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached a gathering of men who were seated
at a table in the open air&mdash;some long boards laid on
trestles.</p>
<p>Overton and his friend were called to seats at the head
of the table, where the &#8220;boss&#8221; of the construction gang
sat. The rough pleasantries of the men, and the way they
made room for him, showed that the big bronzed ranger
was a favorite visitor along the &#8220;works.&#8221;</p>
<p>They looked with some curiosity at his more finely
garbed companion, but he returned their regard with a
good deal of careless audacity, and won their liking by
his independence. But in the midst of the social studies
he was making of them, he heard Overton say:</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have not heard of a white girl in this
vicinity?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never a girl. Are you looking for one? Old Akkomi,
the Indian, has gone into camp across the river, and
he might have a red one to spare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; agreed Overton. &#8220;He&#8217;s an old acquaintance
of mine&mdash;a year old. But I&#8217;m not looking for red
girls just now, and I&#8217;m going to tell the old man to keep
the families clear of your gang, too.&#8221; Then to Lyster he
remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether these people know it or not, there is a white
girl in the Indian camp&mdash;a young girl, too; and before
we sleep, we&#8217;ll see who she is.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<h3>IN THE LODGE OF AKKOMI.</h3>
</div>

<p>The earliest stars had picked their way through the
blue canopy, when the men from the camp crossed over
to the fishing village of the Indians; for it was only when
the moon of May, or of June, lightened the sky that the
red men moved their lodges to the north&mdash;their winter
resort was the States.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan&mdash;umph! How?&#8221; grunted a tall brave lounging
at the opening of the tepee. He arose, and took his
pipe from his lips, glancing with assumed indifference
at the handsome young stranger, though, in reality,
Black Bow was not above curiosity.</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; returned Overton, and reached out his hand.
&#8220;I am glad to see that the lodges by the river hold
friends instead of strangers,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;This, too,
is a friend&mdash;one from the big ocean where the sun rises.
We call him Max.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Umph! How?&#8221; and Lyster glanced in comical dismay
at his friend as his hand was grasped by one so
dirty, so redolent of cooked fish, as the one Black Bow
was gracious enough to offer him.</p>
<p>Thereupon they were asked to seat themselves on
the blanket of that dignitary&mdash;no small favor in the
eyes of an Indian. Overton talked of the fish, and the
easy markets there would soon be for them, when the
boats and the cars came pushing swiftly through the
forests; of the many wolves Black Bow had killed in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
the winter past; of how well the hunting shirt of deer-skin
had worn that Black Bow&#8217;s squaw had sold him
when he met them last on the trail; of any and many
things but the episode of the evening of which Lyster
was waiting to hear.</p>
<p>As the dusk fell, Lyster fully appreciated the picturesque
qualities of the scene before him. The many
dogs and their friendly attentions disturbed him somewhat,
but he sat there feeling much as if in a theater;
for those barbarians, in their groupings, reminded him
of bits of stage setting he had seen at some time or another.</p>
<p>One big fire was outside the lodges, and over it a
big kettle hung, and the steam drifted up and over the
squaws and children gathered there. Some of them
came over and looked at him, and several grunted at
Overton. Black Bow would order them away once in a
while with a lordly &#8220;Klehowyeh,&#8221; much as he did the
dogs; and, like the dogs, they would promptly return,
and gaze with half-veiled eyes at the elegance of the
high boots covering the shapely limbs of Mr. Lyster.</p>
<p>The men were away on a hunt, Black Bow explained;
only he and Akkomi, the head chief, had not gone. Akkomi
was growing very old and no longer led the
hunts; therefore a young chief must ever be near to
his call; so Black Bow was also absent from the hunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;We stay until two suns rise,&#8221; and Overton pointed
across to the camp of the whites. &#8220;To-morrow I would
ask that Black Bow and the chief Akkomi eat at our
table. This is the kinsman&mdash;<i>tillicums</i>&mdash;of the men who
make the great work where the mines are and the boats
that are big and the cars that go faster than the horses
run. He wants that the two great chiefs of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
Kootenais eat of his food before he goes back again to the
towns of the white people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyster barely repressed a groan as he heard the proposal
made, but Overton was blandly oblivious of the
appealing expression of his friend; the thing he was interested
in was to bring Black Bow to a communicative
mood, for not a sign could he discover of a white woman
in the camp, though he was convinced there was or had
been one there.</p>
<p>The invitation to eat succeeded. Black Bow would
tell the old chief of their visit; maybe he would talk
with them now, but he was not sure. The chief was
tired, his thoughts had been troubled that day. The
son of his daughter had been near death in the river
there. He was only a child, and could not swim yet; a
young squaw of the white people had kept him from
drowning, and the squaw of Akkomi had been making
medicines for her ever since.</p>
<p>&#8220;Young squaw! Where comes a white squaw from
to the Kootenai lakes?&#8221; asked Overton, incredulously.
&#8220;Half white, half red, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;White,&#8221; affirmed their host. &#8220;Where? Humph!
Where come the sea-birds from that get lost when they
fly too far from shore? Kootenai not know, but they
drop down sometimes by the rivers. So this one has
come. She has talked with Akkomi; but he tell nothing;
only maybe we will all dance a dance some day, and
then she will be Kootenai, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Adopt</i> her,&#8221; muttered Overton, and glanced at Lyster;
but that gentleman&#8217;s attention was given at the
moment to a couple of squaws who walked past and
looked at him out of the corners of their eyes, so he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
missed that portion of Black Bow&#8217;s figurative information.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have need to see the chief Akkomi,&#8221; said Overton,
after a moment&#8217;s thought. &#8220;It would be well if I could
see him before sleeping. Of these,&#8221; producing two colored
handkerchiefs, &#8220;will you give one to him, that he
may know I am in earnest, the other will you not wear
for Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>The brave grunted a pleased assent, and carefully selecting
the handkerchief with the brightest border,
thrust it within his hunting shirt. He then proceeded
to the lodge of the old chief, bearing the other ostentatiously
in his hand, as though he were carrying the fate
of his nation in the gaudy bit of silk and cotton weaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you trading for?&#8221; asked Lyster, and looked
like protesting, when Overton answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;An audience with Akkomi.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Great Cæsar! is one of that sort not enough? I&#8217;ll
never feel that my hand is clean again until I can give it
a bath with some sort of disinfectant stuff. Now there&#8217;s
another one to greet! I&#8217;ll not be able to eat fish again
for a year. Why didn&#8217;t luck send the old vagabond
hunting with the rest? I can endure the women, for
they don&#8217;t sprawl around you and shake hands with you.
Just tell me what I&#8217;m to donate for being allowed to
bask in the light of Akkomi&#8217;s countenance? Haven&#8217;t a
thing over here but some cigars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton only laughed silently, and gave more attention
to the lodge of Akkomi than to his companion&#8217;s disgust.
When Black Bow emerged from the tent, he watched
him sharply as he approached, to learn from the Indian&#8217;s
countenance, if possible, the result of the message.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he sends a royal request that we partake of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
supper, I warn you, I shall be violently and immediately
taken ill&mdash;too ill to eat,&#8221; whispered Lyster, meaningly.</p>
<p>Black Bow seated himself, filled his pipe, handed it to
a squaw to light, and then sent several puffs of smoke
skyward, ere he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Akkomi is old, and the time for his rest has come.
He says the door of his lodge is open&mdash;that Dan may
go within and speak what there is to say. But the
stranger&mdash;he must wait till the day comes again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Snubbed me, by George!&#8221; laughed Lyster. &#8220;Well,
am I then to wait outside the portals, and be content
with the crumbs you choose to carry out to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, amuse yourself,&#8221; returned Overton, carelessly,
and was on his feet at once. &#8220;I leave you to the enjoyment
of Black Bow.&#8221;</p>
<p>A moment later he reached the lodge of the old chief
and, without ceremony, walked in to the center of it.</p>
<p>A slight fire was there,&mdash;just enough to kill the dampness
of the river&#8217;s edge, and over it the old squaw of
Akkomi bent, raking the dry sticks, until the flames
fluttered upward and outlined the form of the chief,
coiled on a pile of skins and blankets against the wall.</p>
<p>He nodded a welcome, said &#8220;Klehowyeh,&#8221; and motioned
with his pipe that his visitor should be seated on
another pile of clothing and bedding, near his own
person.</p>
<p>Then it was that Overton discovered a fourth person
in the shadows opposite him&mdash;the white woman he had
been curious about.</p>
<p>And it was not a woman at all,&mdash;only a girl of perhaps
sixteen years instead&mdash;who shrank back into the gloom,
and frowned on him with great, dark, unchildlike eyes,
and from under brows wide and straight as those of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
sculptor&#8217;s model for a young Greek god; for, if any
beauty of feature was hers, it was boyish in its character.
As for beauty of expression, she assuredly did not cultivate
that. The curved red mouth was sullen and the eyes
antagonistic.</p>
<p>One sharp glance showed Overton all this, and also
that there was no Indian blood back of the rather pale
cheek.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you got out of the water alive, did you?&#8221; he
asked, in a matter of fact way, as though the dip in the
river was a usual thing to see.</p>
<p>She raised her eyes and lowered them again with a
sort of insolence, as though to show her resentment of
the fact that he addressed her at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather guess I&#8217;m alive,&#8221; she answered, curtly, and
the visitor turned to the chief.</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw to-day your child&#8217;s child in the waters of the
Kootenai. I saw the white friend lifting him up out
of the river, and fighting with death for him. It would
have been a good thing for a man to do, Akkomi. I
crossed the water to-night, to see if your boy is well
once more, or if there is any way I can do service for the
young white squaw who is your friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old Indian smoked in silence for a full minute.
He was a sharp-eyed, shrewd-faced old fellow. When
he spoke, it was in the Chinook jargon, and with a significant
nod toward the girl, as though she was not to
hear or understand his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true, the son of my daughter is again alive. The
breath was gone when the young squaw reached him,
but she was in time. Dan know the young squaw, maybe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Akkomi. Who?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span></p>
<p>The old fellow shook his head, as if not inclined to
give the information required.</p>
<p>&#8220;She tell white men if she want white men to know,&#8221;
he observed. &#8220;The heart of Akkomi is heavy for her&mdash;heavy.
A lone trail is a hard one for a squaw in the
Kootenai land&mdash;a white squaw who is young. She
rests here, and may eat of our meat all her days if she
will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton glanced again at the girl, who was evidently,
from the words of the chief, following some lone trail
through the wilderness,&mdash;a trail starting whence, and
leading whither? All that he could read was that no
happiness kept her company.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the life of a red squaw in the white men&#8217;s camps
is a bad life,&#8221; resumed the old man, after a season of
deliberation; &#8220;and the life of the white squaw in the
red man&#8217;s village is bad as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton nodded gravely, but said nothing. By the
manner of Akkomi, he perceived that some important
thought was stirring in the old man&#8217;s mind, and that it
would develop into speech all the sooner if not hurried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of all the men of the white camps it is you Akkomi
is gladdest to talk to this day,&#8221; continued the chief,
after another season of silence; &#8220;for you, Dan, talk
with a tongue that is straight, and you go many times
where the great towns are built.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The words of Akkomi are true words,&#8221; assented
Overton, &#8220;and my ears listen to hear what he will say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where the white men live is where this young white
squaw should live,&#8221; said Akkomi, and the listening
squaw of Akkomi grunted assent. It was easy to read
that she looked with little favor on the strange white
girl within their lodge. To be sure, Akkomi was growing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
old; but the wife of Akkomi had memories of his
lusty youth and of various wars she had been forced to
wage on ambitious squaws who fancied it would be well
to dwell in the lodge of the head chief.</p>
<p>And remembering those days, though so long past,
the old squaw was sorely averse to the adoption dance
for the white girl who lay on their blankets, and thought
it good, indeed, that she go to live in the villages of the
white people.</p>
<p>Overton nodded gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak wisely, Akkomi,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Glancing at the girl, Dan noted that she was leaning
forward and gazing at him intently. Her face gave him
the uncomfortable feeling that she perhaps knew what
they were talking of, but she dropped back into the
shadows again, and he dismissed the idea as improbable,
for white girls were seldom versed in the lore of Indian
jargon.</p>
<p>He waited a bit for Akkomi to continue, but as that
dignitary evidently thought he had said enough, if Overton
chose to interpret it correctly, the white man asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Would it please Akkomi that I, Dan, should lead
the young squaw where white families are?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It is that I thought of when I heard your name.
I am old. I cannot take her. She has come a long way
on a trail for that which has not been found, and her
heart is so heavy she does not care where the next trail
leads her. So it seems to Akkomi. But she saved the son
of my daughter, and I would wish good to her. So, if
she is willing, I would have her go to your people.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she is willing!&#8221; Overton doubted it, and thought
of the scowl with which she had answered him before.
After a little hesitation, he said: &#8220;It shall be as you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
wish. I am very busy now, but to serve one who is your
friend I will take time for a few days. Do you know
the girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know her, and her father before her. It was long
ago, but my eyes are good. I remember. She is good&mdash;girl
not afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Father! Where is her father?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In the grave blankets&mdash;so she tells me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And her name&mdash;what is she called?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Akkomi was not to be stripped of all his knowledge
by questions. He puffed at the pipe in silence and
then, as Overton was as persistently quiet as himself, he
finally said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The white girl will tell to you the things she wants
you to know, if she goes with your people. If she stays
here, the lodge of Akkomi has a blanket for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl was now face downward on the couch of
skins, and when Overton wished to speak to her he
crossed over and gently touched her shoulder. He was
almost afraid she was weeping, because of the position;
but when she raised her head he saw no signs of tears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you come to me?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
troubling the white folks any. Huh! I didn&#8217;t even stop
at their camp across the river.&#8221;</p>
<p>The grunt of disdain she launched at him made him
smile. It was so much more like that of an Indian than
a white person, yet she was white, despite all the red
manners she chose to adopt.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I reckon you didn&#8217;t stop at the white camp, else
I&#8217;d have heard of it. But as you&#8217;re alone in this country,
don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;d be better off where other white
women live?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>He spoke in the kindliest tone, and she only bit her
lip and shrugged her angular shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will see that you are left with good people,&#8221; he continued;
&#8220;so don&#8217;t be afraid about that. I&#8217;m Dan Overton.
Akkomi will tell you I&#8217;m square. I know where
there&#8217;s a good sort of white woman who would be glad
to have you around, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it your wife?&#8221; she demanded, with the same sullen,
suspicious wrinkle between her brows.</p>
<p>His face paled ever so little and he took a step backward,
as he looked at her through narrowing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, miss, it is not my wife,&#8221; he said, curtly, and
then walked back and sat down beside the old chief. &#8220;In
fact, she isn&#8217;t any relation to me, but she&#8217;s the nearest
white woman I know to leave you with. If you want to
go farther, I reckon I can help you. Anyway, you come
along across the line to Sinna Ferry, and I feel sure
you&#8217;ll find friends there.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him unbelievingly. &#8220;She&#8217;s used to being
deceived,&#8221; decided Overton, as she watched him;
but he stood her gaze without flinching and smiled back
at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you live there?&#8221; she asked again, in that abrupt,
uncivil way, and turned her eyes to Akkomi, as though
to read his countenance as well as that of the white
man,&mdash;a difficult thing, however, for the head of the
old man was again shrouded in his blanket, from which
only the tip of his nose and his pipe protruded.</p>
<p>In a far corner the squaw of Akkomi was crouched,
her bead-like eyes glittering with a watchful interest, as
they turned from one to the other of the speakers, and
missed no tone or gesture of the two so strangely met
within her tepee. Overton noticed her once, and thought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
what a subject for a picture Lyster would think the
whole thing&mdash;at long range. He would want to view
it from the door of the tepee, and not from the interior.</p>
<p>But the questioning eyes of the girl were turned to
him, and remembering them, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Live there? Well, as much&mdash;a little more than I do
anywhere else of late. I am to go there in two days;
and if you are ready to go, I will take you and be glad
to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know anything about me,&#8221; she protested.</p>
<p>He smiled, for her tone told him she was yielding.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no&mdash;not much,&#8221; he confessed, &#8220;but you can tell
me, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I can, but I won&#8217;t,&#8221; she said, doggedly. &#8220;So
I guess you&#8217;ll just move on down to the ferry without
me. He knows, and he says I can live here if I want to.
I&#8217;m tired of the white people. A girl alone is as well
with the Indians. I think so, anyway, and I guess I&#8217;ll
try camping with them. They don&#8217;t ask a word&mdash;only
what I tell myself. They don&#8217;t even care whether I have
a name; they would give me one if I hadn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A suitable name&mdash;and a nice Indian one&mdash;for you
would be, &#8217;The Water Rat&#8217; or &#8217;The Girl Who Swims.&#8217;
Maybe,&#8221; he added, &#8220;they will hunt you up one more
like poetry in books (the only place one finds poetry in
Indians), &#8217;Laughing Eyes,&#8217; or &#8217;The One Who Smiles.&#8217;
Oh, yes, they&#8217;ll find you a name fast enough. So will I,
if you have none. But you have, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have, and it&#8217;s &#8217;Tana,&#8221; said the girl, piqued
into telling by the humorous twinkle in the man&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana? Why, that itself is an Indian name, is it
not? And you are not Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s &#8217;Tana, for short. Montana is my name.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is? Well, you&#8217;ve got a big name, little girl, and
as it is proof that you belong to the States, don&#8217;t you
think you&#8217;d better let me take you back there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t going down among white folks who will turn
up their noses at me, just because you found me among
these redskins,&#8221; she answered, scowling at him and
speaking very deliberately. &#8220;I know how proud decent
women are, and I ain&#8217;t going among any other sort
and that&#8217;s settled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you poor little one, what sort of folks have you
been among?&#8221; he asked, compassionately. Her stubborn
antagonism filled him with more of pity than tears
could have done; it showed so much suspicion, that
spoke of horrible associations, and she was so young!</p>
<p>&#8220;See here! No one need know I found you among
the Indians. I can make up some story&mdash;say you&#8217;re the
daughter of an old partner of mine. It&#8217;ll be a lie, of
course, and I don&#8217;t approve of lies. But if it makes you
feel better, it goes just the same! Partner dies, you
know, and I fall heir to you. See? Then, of course,
I pack you back to civilization, where you can&mdash;well,
go to school or something. How&#8217;s that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer, only looked at him strangely, from
under those straight brows. He felt an angry impatience
with her that she did not take the proposal differently,
when it was so plainly for her good he was making
schemes.</p>
<p>&#8220;As to your father being dead&mdash;that part of it would
be true enough, I suppose,&#8221; he continued; &#8220;for Akkomi
told me he was dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;yes, he is dead,&#8221; she said coldly, and her tones
were so even no one would imagine it was her father
she spoke of.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your mother, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My mother, too,&#8221; she assented. &#8220;But I told you I
wasn&#8217;t going to talk any more about myself, and I ain&#8217;t.
If I can&#8217;t go to your Sunday-school without a pedigree,
I&#8217;ll stop where I am&mdash;that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke with the independence of a boy, and it was,
perhaps, her independence that induced the man to be
persistent.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, &#8217;Tana,&#8221; he said cheerfully. &#8220;You come
along on your own terms, so long as you get out of these
quarters. I&#8217;ll tell the dead partner story&mdash;only the partner
must have a name, you know. Montana is a good
name, but it is only a half one, after all. You can give
me another, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated a little and stared at the glowing embers
of the lodge fire. He wondered if she was deciding
to tell him a true one, or if she was trying to think of a
fictitious one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; he said at last.</p>
<p>Then she looked up, and the sullen, troubled, unchildlike
eyes made him troubled for her sake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rivers is a good name&mdash;Rivers?&#8221; she asked, and he
nodded his head, grimly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;But you give it just because
you were baptized in the river this evening, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I give it because I haven&#8217;t any other I intend
to be called by,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will cut loose from this outfit?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;You will come with me, little girl, across there into
God&#8217;s country, where you must belong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t let them look down on me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If any one looks down on you, it will be because of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
something you will do in the future, &#8217;Tana,&#8221; he said,
looking at her very steadily. &#8220;Understand that, for I will
settle it that no one knows how I came across you. And
you will go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, now! that&#8217;s a good decision&mdash;the best you
could have made, little girl; and I&#8217;ll take care of you as
though you were a cargo of gold. Shake hands on the
agreement, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She held out her hand, and the old squaw in the
corner grunted at the symbol of friendship. Akkomi
watched them with his glittering eyes, but made no sign.</p>
<p>It surely was a strange beginning to a strange friendship.</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor little thing!&#8221; said Overton, compassionately,
as she half shrank from the clasp of his fingers. The
tender tone broke through whatever wall of indifference
she had built about her, for she flung herself face downward
on the couch, and sobbed passionately, refusing to
speak again, though Overton tried in vain to calm her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<h3>THE IMAGE-MAKER.</h3>
</div>

<p>The world was a night older ere Dan Overton informed
Lyster that they would have an addition of one
to their party when they continued their journey into the
States.</p>
<p>On leaving the village of Akkomi but little conversation
was to be had from Dan. In vain did his friend endeavor
to learn something of the white squaw who swam
so well. He simply kept silence, and looked with provoking
disregard on all attempts to surprise him into disclosures.</p>
<p>But when the camp breakfast was over, and he had
evidently thought out his plan of action, he told Lyster
over the sociable influence of a pipe, that he was going
over to the camp of Akkomi again.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact, is, Max, that the girl we saw yesterday is
to go across home with us. She&#8217;s a ward of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; demanded Max, sitting bolt upright in his
amazement, &#8220;a ward of yours? You say that as though
you had several scattered among the tribes about here.
So it is a Kootenai Pocahontas! What good advice was
it you gave me yesterday about keeping clear of Selkirk
Range females? And now you are deliberately gathering
one to yourself, and I will be the unnecessary third on
our journey home. Dan! Dan! I wouldn&#8217;t have thought
it of you!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>Overton listened in silence until the first outburst was
over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Through?&#8221; he asked, carelessly; &#8220;well, then, it isn&#8217;t
a Pocahontas; it isn&#8217;t an Indian at all. It is only a little
white girl whose father was&mdash;was an old partner. Well,
he&#8217;s gone &#8216;over the range&#8217;&mdash;dead, you know&mdash;and the
girl is left to hustle for herself. Naturally, she heard I
was in this region, and as none of her daddy&#8217;s old friends
were around but me, she just made her camp over there
with the Kootenais, and waited till I reached the river
again. She&#8217;ll go with me down to Sinna; and if she
hasn&#8217;t any other home in prospect, I&#8217;ll just locate her there
with Mrs. Huzzard, the milliner-cook, for the present.
Now, that&#8217;s the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a very pretty little one it is, too,&#8221; agreed Mr.
Max. &#8220;For a backwoodsman, who is not supposed to
have experience, it is very well put together. Oh, don&#8217;t
frown like that! I&#8217;ll believe she&#8217;s your granddaughter,
if you say so,&#8221; and he laughed in wicked enjoyment at
Overton&#8217;s flushed face. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Dan. I congratulate
you. But I wouldn&#8217;t have thought it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose, now,&#8221; remarked Dan, witheringly, &#8220;that
by all these remarks and giggles you are trying to be
funny. Is that it? Well, as the fun of it is not visible
to me yet, I&#8217;ll just keep my laughter till it is. In the
meantime, I&#8217;m going over to call on my ward, Miss
Rivers, and you can hustle for funny things around camp
until I come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, say, Dan, don&#8217;t be vindictive. Take me along,
won&#8217;t you? I&#8217;ll promise to be good&mdash;&#8217;pon honor I will.
I&#8217;ll do penance for any depraved suspicions I may have
indulged in. I&#8217;ll&mdash;I&#8217;ll even shake hands again with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
Black Bow, there! Beyond that, I can think of no more
earnest testimony of repentance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall go by myself,&#8221; decided Overton. &#8220;So make
a note of it, if you see the young lady before to-morrow,
it will be because she specially requests it. Understand?
I&#8217;m not going to have her bothered by people who are
only curious; not but that she can take her own part, as
you&#8217;ll maybe learn later. But she was too upset to talk
much last night. So I&#8217;ll go over and finish this morning,
and in the meantime, this side of the river is plenty
good enough for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; murmured Mr. Lyster, as he eyed the stalwart
form of the retreating guardian, who was so bent
on guarding. &#8220;Well, it would do my heart good, anyway,
to fasten another canoe right alongside of yours
where you land over there, and I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised
if I did it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus it happened that while Overton was skimming
upward across the river, his friend, on mischief bent,
was getting a canoe ready to launch. A few minutes
after Overton had disappeared toward the Indian village,
the second canoe danced lightly over the Kootenai, and
the occupant laughed to himself, as he anticipated the
guardian&#8217;s surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not that I care in the least about seeing the dismal
damsel he has to look after,&#8221; mused Lyster. &#8220;In fact,
I&#8217;m afraid she&#8217;ll be a nuisance, and spoil our jolly good
time all the way home. But he is so refreshingly earnest
about everything. And as he doesn&#8217;t care a snap for
girls in general, it is all the more amusing that it
is he who should have a charge of that sort left on his
hands. I&#8217;d like to know what she looks like. Common,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
I dare say, for the ultra refined do not penetrate these
wilds to help blaze trails; and she swam like a boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>When he reached the far shore, no one was in sight.
With satisfied smiles, he fastened his canoe to that of
Overton, and then cast about for some place to lie in
wait for that selfish personage and surprise him on his
return.</p>
<p>He had no notion of going up to the village, for he
wanted only to keep close enough to trace Overton.
Hearing children&#8217;s voices farther along the shore, he
sauntered that way, thinking to see Indian games, perhaps.
When he came nearer, he saw they were running
races.</p>
<p>The contestants were running turn about, two at a
time. Each victory was greeted with shrill cries of
triumph. He also noticed that each victor returned to a
figure seated close under some drooping bushes, and
each time a hand was reached out and some little prize
was given to the winner. Then, with shouts of rejoicing,
a new race was planned.</p>
<p>As the stranger stood back of the thick bushes, watching
the stretch of level beach and the half-naked, childish
figures, he grew curious to see who that one person just
out of sight was.</p>
<p>One thing at last he did discover&mdash;that the hand
awarding the prizes was tanned like the hand of a boy,
but that it certainly had white blood instead of red in
its veins. What if it should be the ward?</p>
<p>Elated, and full of mischief, he crept closer. If only
he could be able to give Overton a description of her
when Overton came back to the canoe!</p>
<p>At first all he could see were the hands&mdash;hands playing
with a bit of wet clay&mdash;or so it seemed to him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>Then his curiosity was more fully aroused when out
of the mass a recognizable form was apparent&mdash;a crudely
modeled head and shoulders of a decided Indian character.</p>
<p>Lyster was so close now that he could notice how small
the hands were, and to see that the head bent above them
was covered with short, brown, loosely curled hair, and
that there was just a tinge of reddish gold on it, where
the sunlight fell.</p>
<p>A race was just ended, and one of the little young
savages trotted up where the image-maker was. The
small hand was again reached out, and he could see that
the prize the little Indian had raced for was a blue bead
of glass. He could see, also, that the owner of the hand
had the face of a girl&mdash;a girl with dark eyes, and long
lashes that touched the rather pale cheeks. Her mouth
was deliciously saucy, with its bow-like curve, and its
clear redness. She said something he did not understand,
and the children scampered away to resume the
endless races, while she continued the manipulation of
the clay, frowning often when it would not take the desired
form.</p>
<p>Then one of the sharp-eyed little redskins left his companions
and slipped back to her, and said something in
a tone so low it was almost a whisper.</p>
<p>She turned at once and looked directly into the thicket,
back of which Lyster stood.</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you watching for?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t like people who are afraid to show themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll try to change that as quickly as I can,&#8221;
Lyster retorted, and circling the clump of bushes, he
stood before her with his hat in his hand, looking smilingly
audacious as she frowned on him.</p>
<p>But the frown faded as she looked; perhaps because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
&#8217;Tana had never seen any one quite so handsome in all
her life, or so fittingly and picturesquely dressed, for
Mr. Maxwell Lyster was artist enough to make the most
of his many good points and to exhibit them all with
charming unconsciousness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will like me better here than across
there,&#8221; he said, with a smile that was contagious. &#8220;You
see, I was too shy to come forward at first, and then I
was afraid to interrupt your modeling. It is very good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look shy,&#8221; she said, combatively, and drew
the clay image back, where he could not look at it. She
was not at all sure that he was not laughing at her,
and she covered her worn shoes with the skirt of her
dress, feeling suddenly very poor and shabby in the
light of his eyes. She had not felt at all like that when
Overton looked at her in Akkomi&#8217;s lodge.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not be so unfriendly if you knew who I
am,&#8221; he ventured meekly. &#8220;Of course, I&mdash;Max Lyster&mdash;don&#8217;t
amount to much, but I happen to be Dan Overton&#8217;s
friend, and with your permission, I hope to continue
with him to Sinna Ferry, and with you as well; for I am
sure you must be Miss Rivers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re sure, that settles it, I suppose,&#8221; she returned.
&#8220;So he&mdash;he told you about me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; we are chums, as you will learn. Then I
was so fortunate as to see your brave swim after that
child yesterday. You don&#8217;t look any the worse for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose, now, you thought that little dip a welcome
break in the monotony of camp-life, while you were waiting
for Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him in a quick, questioning way he
thought odd.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;yes. While I was waiting for&mdash;Dan,&#8221; she said
in a queer tone, and bent her head over the clay image.</p>
<p>He thought her very interesting with her boyish air,
her brusqueness, and independence. Yet, despite her
savage surroundings, a certain amount of education was
visible in her speech and manner, and her face had no
stamp of ignorance on it.</p>
<p>The young Kootenais silently withdrew from their
races, and gathered watchfully close to the girl. Their
nearness was a discomfiting thing to Lyster, for it was
not easy to carry on a conversation under their watchful
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You gave them prizes, did you not?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;How
much wealth must one offer to get them to run?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Run where?&#8221; she returned carelessly, though quietly
amused at the scrutiny of the little redskins. They were
especially charmed by the glitter of gold mountings on
Mr. Lyster&#8217;s watch-guard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, run races&mdash;run anywhere,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>From a pocket of her blouse she drew forth a few blue
beads that yet remained.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is all I had to give them, and they run just as
fast for one of these as they would for a pony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough! I&#8217;ll have some races for my own edification
and comfort,&#8221; and he drew out some coins. &#8220;Will
you run for this&mdash;run far over there?&#8221;</p>
<p>The children looked at the girl. She nodded her head,
said a word or two unintelligible to him, but perfectly
clear to them; for, with sharp looks at the coins and
pleased yells, they leaped away to their racing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, this is more comfortable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;May I
sit down here? Thanks! Now would you mind telling
me whose likeness it is you are making in the clay?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you know it&#8217;s nobody&#8217;s likeness,&#8221; she answered,
and again thrust it back out of sight, her face
flushing that he should thus make a jest of her poor
efforts. &#8220;You&#8217;ve seen real statues, I suppose, and know
how they ought to be, but you don&#8217;t need to look for
them in the Purcell Range.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, indeed, I am in earnest about your modeling.
Won&#8217;t you believe me?&#8221; and the blue eyes looking into
her own were so appealing, that she turned away her head
half shyly, and a pink flush crept up from her throat.
Miss Rivers was evidently not used to eyes with caressive
tendencies and they disturbed her, for all her
strangely unchildlike character.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, your work is only in the rough,&#8221; he continued;
&#8220;but it is not at all bad, and has real Indian features.
And if you have had no teaching&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; and she looked at him with a mirthless smile.
&#8220;Where&#8217;d any one get teaching of that sort along the
Columbia River? Of course, there are some gentlemen&mdash;officers
and such&mdash;about the reservations, but not one
but would only laugh at such a big girl making doll
babies out of mud. No, I had no teaching to do anything
but read, and I did read some in a book about a sculptor,
and how he made animals and people&#8217;s faces out of clay.
Then I tried.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she grew communicative, she seemed so much more
what she really was in years&mdash;a child; and he noticed,
with satisfaction, that she looked at him more frankly,
while the suspicion faded almost entirely from her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;And are you going to develop into a sculptor under
Overton&#8217;s guardianship?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;You see, he has
told me of his good luck.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>She made a queer little sound between a laugh and
a grunt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet the rest of the blue beads he didn&#8217;t call it
good luck,&#8221; she returned, looking at him keenly. &#8220;Now,
honest Injun&mdash;did he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest Injun! he didn&#8217;t speak of it as either good
or bad luck; simply as a matter of course, that at your
father&#8217;s death you should look him up, and let him know
you were alone. Oh, he is a good fellow, Dan is, and
glad, I am sure, to be of use to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her lips opened in a little sigh of content, and a swift,
radiant smile was given him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m right glad you say that about him,&#8221; she answered,
&#8220;and I guess you know him well, too. Akkomi likes him,
and Akkomi&#8217;s sharp.&#8221;</p>
<p>The winner of the race here trotted back for the coin,
and Lyster showed another one, as an incentive for all
to scatter along the beach again. It looked as though
the two white people must pay for the grant of privacy
on the river-bank.</p>
<p>Having grown more at ease with him, &#8217;Tana resumed
again the patting and pressing of the clay, using only
a little pointed stick, while Lyster watched, with curiosity,
the ingenious way in which she seemed to feel
her way to form.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever tried to draw?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only to copy pictures, like I&#8217;ve seen in some papers,
but they never looked right. But I want to do everything
like that&mdash;to make pictures, and statues, and music,
and&mdash;oh, all the lovely things there are somewhere, that
I&#8217;ve never seen&mdash;never will see them, I suppose. Sometimes,
when I get to thinking that I never will see them,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
I just get as ugly as a drunken man, and I don&#8217;t care
if I never do see anything but Indians again. I get so
awful reckless. Say!&#8221; she said, again with that hard,
short laugh, &#8220;girls back your way don&#8217;t get wild like that,
do they? They don&#8217;t talk my way either, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not, and few of them would be able, either,
to do what we saw you do in this river yesterday,&#8221; he
said kindly. &#8220;Dan is a judge of such things, you know,
and he thought you very nervy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nervy? Oh, yes; I guess he&#8217;d be nervy himself if
he was needed. Say! can you tell me about the camp,
or settlement, at this Sinna Ferry? I never was there.
He says white women are there. Do you know them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyster explained his own ignorance of the place,
knowing it as he did only through Dan&#8217;s descriptions.</p>
<p>Then she, from her bit of Indian knowledge, told him
Sinna was the old north Indian name for Beaver. Then
he got her to tell him other things of the Indian country,
things of ghost-haunted places and strange witcheries,
with which they confused the game and the fish. He
fell to wondering what manner of man Rivers, the partner
of Dan, had been, that his daughter had gained such
strange knowledge of the wild things. But any attempt
to learn or question her history beyond yesterday was
always checked in some way or other.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<h3>DAN&#8217;S WARD.</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Max Lyster was not given to the study of deep
problems; his habits of thought did not run in that groove.
But he did watch the young stranger with unusual interest.
Her face puzzled him as much as her presence
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as though I had seen you before,&#8221; he said at
last, and her face grew a shade paler. She did not look
up, and when she spoke, it was very curtly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know&mdash;in fact, I believe it is a resemblance
to some one I know that makes me feel that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I look like some one you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes, you do&mdash;a little&mdash;a lady who is a little
older than you&mdash;a little more of a brunette than you;
yet there is a likeness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does she live&mdash;and what is her name?&#8221; she
asked, with scant ceremony.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t suppose her name would tell you much,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;But it is Miss Margaret Haydon, of Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Margaret Haydon,&#8221; she said slowly, almost contemptuously.
&#8220;So you know her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak as though you did,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;and
as if you did not like the name, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you think it&#8217;s pretty,&#8221; she said, looking at him
sharply. &#8220;No, I don&#8217;t know such swells&mdash;don&#8217;t want to.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know she is a swell?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s a man owns big works across the country,
and that&#8217;s his name. I suppose they are all of a lot,&#8221;
she said, indifferently. &#8220;Say! are there any girls at
Sinna Ferry, any family folks? Dan didn&#8217;t tell me&mdash;only
said there was a white woman there, and I could
live with her. He hasn&#8217;t a wife, has he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan?&#8221; and he laughed at the idea, &#8220;well, no. He is
very kind to women, but I can&#8217;t imagine the sort of
woman he would marry. He is a queer fish, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll think we&#8217;re all that up in this wild
country,&#8221; she observed. &#8220;Does he know much about
books and such things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you know! things of the life in the cities, where
there&#8217;s music and theaters. I love the theaters and pictures!
and&mdash;and&mdash;well, everything like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyster watched her brightening face, and appreciated
all the longing in it for the things he liked well himself.
And she loved the theaters! All his own boyish enthusiasm
of years ago crowded into his memory, as he
looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have seen plays, then?&#8221; he asked, and wondered
where she had seen them along that British Columbia
line.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seen plays! Yes, in &#8217;Frisco, and Portland, and Victoria&mdash;big,
real theaters, you know; and then others in
the big mining camps. Oh, I just dream over plays,
when I do see them, specially when the actresses are
pretty. But I mostly like the villains better than the
heroes. Don&#8217;t know why, but I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What! you like to see their wickedness prosper?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;I think not,&#8221; she said, doubtfully. &#8220;But I tell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
you, the heroes are generally just too good to be live
men, that&#8217;s all. And the villain mostly talks more natural,
gets mad, you know, and breaks things, and rides
over the lay-out as though he had some nerve in him.
Of course, they always make him throw up his hands in
the end, and every man in the audience applauds&mdash;even
the ones who would act just as he does if such a pretty
hero was in their way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you certainly have peculiar ideas of theatrical
personages&mdash;for a young lady,&#8221; decided Lyster, laughing.
&#8220;And why you have a grievance against the orthodox
handsome hero, I can&#8217;t see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s too good,&#8221; she insisted, with the little frown
appearing between her brows, &#8220;and no one is ever started
in the play with a fair chance against him. He is always
called Willie, where the villain would be called
Bill&mdash;now, isn&#8217;t he? Then the girl in the story always
falls in love with him at first sight, and that&#8217;s enough to
rile any villain, especially when he wants her himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; and the face of the young man was a study, as
he inspected this wonderful ward of Dan. Whatever
he had expected from the young swimmer of the Kootenai,
from the welcomed guest of Akkomi, he had not
expected this sort of thing.</p>
<p>She was twisting her pretty mouth, with a schoolgirl&#8217;s
earnestness, over a problem, and accenting thus her
patient forming of the clay face. She built no barriers
up between herself and this handsome stranger, as she
had in the beginning with Overton. What she had to say
was uttered with all freedom&mdash;her likes, her thoughts,
her ambitions. At first the fineness and perfection of his
apparel had been as grandeur and insolence when contrasted
with her own weather-stained, coarse skirt of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
wool, and her boy&#8217;s blouse belted with a strap of leather.
Even the blue beads&mdash;her one feminine bit of adornment&mdash;had
been stripped from her throat, that she might give
some pleasure to the little bronze-tinted runners on the
shore. But the gently modulated, sympathetic tones of
Lyster and the kindly fellowship in his eyes, when he
looked at her, almost made her forget her own shabbiness
(all but those hideous coarse shoes!) for he talked
to her with the grace of the people in the plays she loved
so, and had not once spoken as though to a stray found
in the shelter of an Indian camp.</p>
<p>But he did look curious when she expressed those independent
ideas on questions over which most girls
would blush or appear at least a little conscious.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, you would put a veto on love at first sight, would
you?&#8221; he asked, laughingly. &#8220;And the beauty of the
hero would not move you at all? What a very odd young
lady you would have me think you! I believe love at
first sight is generally considered, by your age and sex,
the pinnacle of all things hoped for.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little color did creep into her face at the unnecessary
personal construction put on her words. She frowned
to hide her embarrassment and thrust out her lips in a
manner that showed she had little vanity as to her features
and their attractiveness.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t happen to be a young lady,&#8221; she retorted;
&#8220;and we think as we please up here in the bush. Maybe
your proper young ladies would be very odd, too, if
they were brought up out here like boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>She arose to her feet, and he saw more clearly then
how slight she was; her form and face were much more
childish in character than her speech, and the face was
looking at him with resentful eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, I&#8217;ve offended you, haven&#8217;t I?&#8221; he asked, in surprise.
&#8220;Really, I did not mean to. Won&#8217;t you forgive
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She dug her heel in the sand and did not answer; but
the fact that she remained at all assured him she would
relent. He was amused at her quick show of temper.
What a prospect for Dan!</p>
<p>&#8220;I scarcely know what I said to vex you,&#8221; he began;
but she flashed a sullen look at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You think I&#8217;m odd&mdash;and&mdash;and a nobody; just because
I ain&#8217;t like fine young ladies you know somewheres&mdash;like
Miss Margaret Haydon,&#8221; and she dug the
sand away with vicious little kicks. &#8220;Nice ladies with
kid slippers on,&#8221; she added, derisively, &#8220;the sort that always
falls in love with the pretty man, the hero. Huh!
I&#8217;ve seen some men who were heroes&mdash;real ones&mdash;and
I never saw a pretty one yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>As she said it, she looked very straight into the very
handsome face of Mr. Lyster.</p>
<p>&#8220;A young Tartar!&#8221; he decided, mentally, while he
actually colored at the directness of her gaze and her
sweepingly contemptuous opinion of &#8220;pretty men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see I&#8217;d better vacate your premises since you appear
unwilling to forgive me even my unintentional faults,&#8221;
he decided, meekly. &#8220;I&#8217;m very sorry, I&#8217;m sure, and hope
you will bear no malice. Of course I&mdash;nobody would
want you to be different from what you are; so you
must not think I meant that. I had hoped you would let
me buy that clay bust as a memento of this morning,
but I&#8217;m afraid to ask favors now. I can only hope that
you will speak to me again to-morrow. Until then, good-by.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>She raised her eyes sullenly at first, but they dropped,
ashamed, before the kindness of his own. She felt
coarse and clumsy, and wished she had not been so
quick to quarrel. And he was turning away! Maybe
he would never speak nicely to her again, and she loved
to hear him speak.</p>
<p>Then her hand was thrust out to him, and in it was
the little clay model.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have it. I&#8217;ll give it to you,&#8221; she said, quite
humbly. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t very pretty, but if you like it&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus ended the first of many differences between
Dan&#8217;s ward and Dan&#8217;s friend.</p>
<p>When Daniel Overton himself came stalking down
among the Indian children, looking right and left from
under his great slouch hat, he halted suddenly, and with
his lips closed somewhat grimly, stood there watching
the rather pretty picture before him.</p>
<p>But the prettiness of it did not seem to appeal to him
strongly. He looked on the girl&#8217;s half smiling, drooped
face, on Lyster, who held the model and his hat in one
hand and, with his handsome blonde head bared, held out
his other hand to her, saying something in those low,
deferential tones Dan knew so well.</p>
<p>Her hand was given after a little hesitation. When
they beheld Dan so near them, the hands were unclasped
and each looked confused.</p>
<p>Mr. Lyster was the first to recover, and adjusting his
head covering once more, he held up the clay model to
view.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thought you&#8217;d be around before long,&#8221; he remarked,
with a provoking gleam in his eyes. &#8220;I really had no
hope of meeting Miss Rivers before you this morning;
but fortune favors the brave, you know, and fortune sent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
me right along these sands for my morning walk&mdash;a
most indulgent fortune, for, look at this! Did you know
your ward is an embryo sculptress?&#8221;</p>
<p>The older man looked indifferently enough at the exalted
bit of clay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I leave discoveries of that sort to you. They seem
to run in your line more than mine,&#8221; he answered, briefly.
Then he turned to the girl. &#8220;Akkomi told me you were
here with the children, &#8217;Tana. If you had other company,
Akkomi would have made him welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not speak unkindly, yet she felt that in some
way he was not pleased; and perhaps&mdash;perhaps he would
change his mind and leave her where he found her!
And if so, she might never see&mdash;either of their faces
again! As the thought came to her, she looked up at
Dan in a startled way, and half put out her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I did not know. I don&#8217;t like the lodges. It is
better here by the river. It is <i>your</i> friend that came,
and I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. You need not explain. And as you seem
to know each other, I need not do any introducing,&#8221; he
answered, as she seemed to grow confused. &#8220;But I have
a little time to talk to you this morning and so came
early.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which means that I can set sail for the far shore,&#8221;
added Lyster, amiably. &#8220;All right; I&#8217;m gone. Good-by
till to-morrow, Miss Rivers. I&#8217;m grateful for the clay
Indian, and more grateful that you have agreed to be
friends with me again. Will you believe, Dan, that
in our short acquaintance of half an hour, we have had
time for one quarrel and &#8217;make up&#8217;? It is true. And
now that she is disposed to accept me as a traveling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
companion, don&#8217;t you spoil it by giving me a bad name when
my back is turned. I&#8217;ll wait at the canoes.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a wave of his hat, he passed out of sight around
the clump of bushes, and down along the shore, singing
cheerily, and the words floated back to them:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Come, love! come, love!</p>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>On the Ohio.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Overton stood looking at the girl for a little time after
Lyster disappeared. His eyes were very steady and
searching, as though he began to realize the care a ward
might be, especially when the antecedents and past life
of the ward were so much of stubborn mystery to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he said, at last, &#8220;if there is any chance of
your being my friend, too, in so short a time as a half-hour?
Oh, well, never mind,&#8221; he added, as he saw the
red mouth tremble, and tears show in her eyes as she
looked at him. &#8220;Only don&#8217;t commence by disliking,
that&#8217;s all; for unfriendliness is a bad thing in a household,
let alone in a canoe, and I can be of more downright
use to you, if you give me all the confidence you
can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you mean&mdash;that I must tell you about&mdash;about
how I came here, and all; but I won&#8217;t!&#8221; she
burst out. &#8220;I&#8217;ll die here before I do! I hated the people
they said were my people. I was glad when they were
dead&mdash;glad&mdash;glad! Oh, you&#8217;ll say it&#8217;s wicked to think
that way about relatives. Maybe it is, but it&#8217;s natural
if they&#8217;ve always been wicked to you. I&#8217;ll go to the
bad place, I reckon, for feeling this way, and I&#8217;ll just
have to go, for I can&#8217;t feel any other way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana&mdash;<i>&#8217;Tana!</i>&#8221; and his hand fell on her shoulder,
as though to shake her away from so wild a mood. &#8220;You
are only a girl yet. When you are older, you will be
ashamed to say you ever hated your parents&mdash;whoever
they were&mdash;your mother!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t saying anything about her,&#8221; she answered
bitterly. &#8220;She died before I can mind. I&#8217;ve been told
she was a lady. But I won&#8217;t ever use the name again
she used. I&mdash;I want to start square with the world, if
I leave these Indians, and I can&#8217;t do it unless I change
my name and try to forget the old one. It has a curse on
it&mdash;it has.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was trembling with nervousness, and her eyes,
though tearless, were stormy and rebellious.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m bad, because I talk this way,&#8221; she
continued, &#8220;but I ain&#8217;t&mdash;I ain&#8217;t. I&#8217;ve fought when I had
to, and&mdash;and I&#8217;d swear&mdash;sometimes; but that&#8217;s all the
bad I ever did do. I won&#8217;t any more if you take me with
you. I&mdash;I can cook and keep house for you, if you hain&#8217;t
got folks of your own, and&mdash;I do want to go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words of the handsome singer came clearly back
to them. Overton, about to speak, heard the words of
the song, and a little smile, half-bitter, half-sad, touched
his lips as he looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; he said, quietly, &#8220;you care more about going
to-day, than you did when I talked to you last night.
Well, that&#8217;s all right. And I reckon you can make
coffee for me as long as you like. That mayn&#8217;t be long,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
though, for some of the young fellows will be wanting
you to keep house for them before many years, and you&#8217;ll
naturally do it. How old are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m&mdash;past sixteen,&#8221; she said, in a deprecating way,
as though ashamed of her years and her helplessness.
&#8220;I&#8217;m old enough to work, and I will work if I get where
it&#8217;s any use trying. But I won&#8217;t keep house for any one
but you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked, doubtfully. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve an
idea you may. But we&#8217;ll talk about that when the time
comes. This morning I wanted to talk of something
else before we start&mdash;you and Max and I&mdash;down into
Idaho. I&#8217;m not asking the name of the man you hate
so; but if I am to acknowledge him as an old acquaintance
of mine, you had better tell me what business he
was in. You see, it might save complications if any
one should run across us some day and know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one will know me,&#8221; she said, decidedly. &#8220;If I
didn&#8217;t know that, I&#8217;d stay right here, I think. And as
to him, my fond parent,&#8221; and she made a grimace&mdash;&#8220;I
guess you can call him a prospector and speculator&mdash;either
of those would be correct. I think they called him
Jim, when he was christened.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Akkomi said last night you had been on the trail
hunting for some one. Was it a friend, or&mdash;or any one
I could help you look for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t a friend, and I&#8217;m done with the search
and glad of it. Did you,&#8221; she added, looking at him
darkly, &#8220;ever put in time hunting for any one you didn&#8217;t
want to find?&#8221;</p>
<p>Without knowing it, Miss Rivers must have touched
on a subject rather sensitive to her guardian, for his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
face flushed, and he gazed at her with a curious expression
in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I have, little girl,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;I reckon
I know how to let your troubles alone, anyway, if I
can&#8217;t help them. But I must tell you, Max&mdash;Max Lyster,
you know&mdash;will be the only one very curious about your
presence here&mdash;as to the route you came, etc. You had
better be prepared for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be very hard,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;for I came
over from Sproats&#8217; Landing, up to Karlo, and back down
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over from Sproats&mdash;you?&#8221; he asked, looking at her
nervously. &#8220;I heard nothing of a white girl making that
trip. When, and how did you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two weeks ago, and on foot,&#8221; was the laconic reply.
&#8220;As I had only a paper of salt and some matches, I
couldn&#8217;t afford to travel in high style, so I footed it. I
had a ring and a blanket, and I traded them up at Karlo
for an old tub of a dugout, and got here in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You had some one with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton looked at her with more of amazement than
she had yet inspired in him. He thought of that indescribably
wild portage trail from the Columbia to the
Kootenai. When men crossed it, they preferred to go
in company, and this slip of a girl had dared its loneliness,
its dangers alone. He thought of the stories of
death, by which the trail was haunted; of prospectors
who had verged from that dim path and had been lost
in the wilderness, where their bones were found by Indians
or white hunters long after; of strange stories of
wild beasts; of all the weird sounds of the jungles; of
places where a misstep would send one lifeless to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
jagged feet of huge precipices. And through that trail
of terror she had walked&mdash;alone!</p>
<p>&#8220;I have nothing more to ask,&#8221; he said briefly. &#8220;But
it is not necessary to tell any of the white people you
meet that you made the trip alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she said, humbly, &#8220;they&#8217;d think it either
wasn&#8217;t true&mdash;or&mdash;or else that it oughtn&#8217;t to be true. I
know how they&#8217;d look at me and whisper things. But
if&mdash;if you believe me&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused uncertainly, and looked up at him. All
the rebellion and passion had faded out of her eyes now:
they were only appealing. What a wild, changeable
creature she was with those quick contrasts of temper!
wild as the name she bore&mdash;Montana&mdash;the mountains.
Something like that thought came into his mind as he
looked at her.</p>
<p>He had gathered other wild things from his trips into
the wilderness; young bears with which to enliven camp
life; young fawns that he had loved and cared for, because
of the beauty of eyes and form; even a pair of
kittens had been carried by him across into the States,
and developed into healthy, marauding panthers. One of
these had set its teeth through the flesh of his hand
one day ere he could conquer and kill it, and his fawns,
cubs and smaller pets had drifted from him back to their
forests, or else into the charge of some other prospector
who had won their affections.</p>
<p>He remembered them, and the remembrance lent a
curious character to the smile in his eyes, as he held
out his hand to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do believe you, for it is only cowards who tell lies;
and I don&#8217;t believe you&#8217;d make a good coward&mdash;would
you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span></p>
<p>She did not answer, but her face flushed with pleasure,
and she looked up at him gratefully. He seemed to like
that better than words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Akkomi called you &#8216;Girl-not-Afraid,&#8217;&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;And if I were a redskin, too, I would look up an eagle
feather for you to wear in your hair. I reckon you&#8217;ve
heard that only the braves dare wear eagle feathers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, but I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have earned them by your own confession,&#8221;
he said, kindly, &#8220;and some day I may run across them
for you. In the meantime, I have only this.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held out a beaded belt of Indian manufacture, a
pretty thing, and she opened her eyes in glad surprise,
as he offered it to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me? Oh, Dan!&mdash;Mr. Overton&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused, confused at having called him as the Indians
called him; but he smiled understandingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll settle that name business right here,&#8221; he suggested.
&#8220;You call me Dan, if it comes easier to you.
Just as I call you &#8217;Tana. I don&#8217;t know &#8217;Mr. Overton&#8217;
very well myself in this country, and you needn&#8217;t trouble
yourself to remember him. Dan is shorter. If I had a
sister, she&#8217;d call me Dan, I suppose; so I give you license
to do so. As to the belt, I got it, with some other plunder,
from some Columbia River reds, and you use it.
There is some other stuff in Akkomi&#8217;s tepee you&#8217;d better
put on, too; it&#8217;s new stuff&mdash;a whole dress&mdash;and I think
the moccasins will about fit you. I brought over two
pairs, to make sure. Now, don&#8217;t get any independent
notions in your head,&#8221; he advised, as she looked at him
as though about to protest. &#8220;If you go to the States as
my ward, you must let me take the management of the
outfit. I got the dress for an army friend of mine, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
wanted it for his daughter; but I guess it will about fit
you, and she will have to wait until next trip. Now, as
I&#8217;ve settled our business, I&#8217;ll be getting back across the
river, so until to-morrow, <i>klahowya</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood, awkward and embarrassed, before him. No
words would come to her lips to thank him. She had
felt desolate and friendless for so long, and now when
his kindness was so great, she felt as if she should cry
if she spoke at all. Just as she had cried the night before
at his compassionate tones and touch.</p>
<p>Suddenly she bent forward for the belt, and with
some muttered words he could not distinguish, she
grasped his big hand in her little brown fingers, and
touching it with her lips, twice&mdash;thrice&mdash;turned and ran
away as swiftly as the little Indians who had run on the
shore.</p>
<p>The warm color flushed all over Dan&#8217;s face, as he
looked after her. Of course, she was only a little girl,
but he was devoutly glad Max was not in sight. Max
would not have understood aright. Then his eyes traveled
back to his hand, where her mouth had touched it.
Her kiss had fallen where the scar of the panther&#8217;s teeth
was.</p>
<p>And this, also, was a wild thing he was taking from
the forests!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<h3>AT SINNA FERRY.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It has been young wolves, an&#8217; bears, an&#8217; other vicious
pets&mdash;every formed thing, but snakes or redskins, and
at last it&#8217;s that!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tush, tush, captain! Now, it&#8217;s not so bad. Why, I
declare, now, I was kind of pleased when I got sight of
her. She&#8217;s white, anyway, and she&#8217;s right smart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Smart!&#8221; The captain sniffed, dubiously. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get
a chance to see about that later on, Mrs. Huzzard. But
it&#8217;s like your&mdash;hem! tender heart to have a good word
for all comers, and this is only another proof of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pshaw! Now, you&#8217;re making game, I guess. That&#8217;s
what you&#8217;re up to, captain,&#8221; and Mrs. Huzzard attempted
a chaste blush and smile, and succeeded in a smirk. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sure, now, that to hem a few neckties an&#8217; sich like for
you is no good reason for thinking I&#8217;m doing the same
for every one that comes around. No, indeed; my heart
ain&#8217;t so tender as all that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain, from under his sandy brows, looked with
a certain air of satisfaction at the well rounded personality
of Mrs. Huzzard. His vanity was gently pleased&mdash;she
was a fine woman!</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I mightn&#8217;t like it so well myself if I thought
you&#8217;d do as much for any man,&#8221; he acknowledged.
&#8220;There&#8217;s too many men at the Ferry who ain&#8217;t fit even
to eat one of the pies you make.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard was fluting the edge of a pie at that
moment, and looked across the table at the captain, with
arch meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe so; but there&#8217;s a right smart lot of fine-looking
fellows among them, too; there&#8217;s no getting around
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The unintelligible mutter of disdain that greeted her
words seemed to bring a certain comfort to her widowed
heart, for she smiled brightly and flipped the completed
pie aside, with an airy grace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&mdash;now, Captain Leek, you can&#8217;t be expecting
common grubbers of men to have all the advantages of
manners that you&#8217;ve got. No, sir; you can&#8217;t. They
hain&#8217;t had the bringing up. They hain&#8217;t had the schooling,
and they hain&#8217;t had the soldier drills to teach them to
carry themselves like gentlemen. Now, you&#8217;ve had all
that, and it&#8217;s a sight of profit to you. But don&#8217;t be too
hard on the folks that ain&#8217;t jest so finished like as you.
There&#8217;s that new Rivers girl, now&mdash;she ain&#8217;t a bad sort,
though it is queer to see your boy Dan toting such a
stranger into camp, for he never did seem to take to girls
much&mdash;did he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not so easy to tell what he&#8217;s taken to in his time,&#8221;
returned the captain, darkly. &#8220;You know he isn&#8217;t my
own boy, as I told you before. He was eight years old
when I married his mother, and after her death he took
the bit in his own teeth, and left home. No great grief
to me, for he wasn&#8217;t a tender boy to manage!&#8221; And
Captain Leek heaved a sigh for the martyrdom he had
lived through.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, but see what a fine man he&#8217;s turned out, and
I&#8217;m sure no own son could be better to you,&#8221; for Mrs.
Huzzard was one of the large, comfortable bodies, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
never see any but the brightest side of affairs, and a good
deal of a peacemaker in the little circle where she had
taken up her abode. &#8220;Indeed, now, captain, you&#8217;ll not
meet many such fine fellows in a day&#8217;s tramp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she&#8217;d even been a real Indian,&#8221; he continued, discontentedly,
&#8220;it would have been easier to manage her&mdash;to&mdash;to
put her in some position where she could earn
her own living; for by Dan&#8217;s words (few enough, too!)
I gather that she has no money back of her. She&#8217;ll be a
dead weight on his hands, that&#8217;s what she&#8217;ll be, and an
expensive savage he&#8217;ll find her, I&#8217;ll prophesy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like enough. Young ones of any sort do take a heap
of looking after. But she&#8217;s smart, as I said before, and
I do think it&#8217;s a sight better to make room for a likely
young girl than to be scared most to death with young
wolves and bears tied around for pets. I was all of a
shiver at night on account of them. I&#8217;ll take the girl
every time. She won&#8217;t scratch an&#8217; claw at folks, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; added the captain, who was too contented
with his discontent to let go of it at once. &#8220;But
no telling what a young animal like that may develop
into. She has no idea whatever of duty, Mrs. Huzzard,
or of&mdash;of veneration. She contradicted me squarely this
morning when I made some comment about those beastly
redskins; actually set up her ignorance against my years
of service under the American flag, Mrs. Huzzard. Yes,
madame! she did that,&#8221; and Captain Leek arose in his
wrath and tramped twice across the room, halting again
near her table and staring at her as though defying her to
justify that.</p>
<p>When he arose, one could see by the slight unsteadiness
in his gait that the cane in his hand was for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
practical use. His limp was not a deformity&mdash;in fact, it
made him rather more interesting because of it; people
would notice or remember him when nothing else in his
personality would cause them to do so.</p>
<p>For Captain Alphonso Leek was not a striking-looking
personage. His blue eyes had a washed-out, querulous
expression. His sandy whiskers had the appearance
of having been blown back from his chin, and
lodged just in front of his ears. An endeavor had been
made to train the outlying portions of his mustache in line
with the lengthy, undulating &#8220;mutton chops;&#8221; but they
had, for well-grounded reasons, failed to connect, and
the effect was somewhat spoiled by those straggling
skirmishers, bristling with importance but waiting in
vain for recruits. The top of his head had got above
timber line and glistened in the sun of early summer
that streamed through the clear windows of Mrs. Huzzard&#8217;s
back room.</p>
<p>But as that head was generally covered by a hat that
sported a cord and tassel, and as his bulging breastbone
was covered by a dark-blue coat and vest, on which the
brass buttons shone in real military fashion&mdash;well, all
those things had their weight in a community where few
men wore a coat at all in warm weather.</p>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard, in the depths of her being, thought it
would be a fine thing to go back to Pennsylvania as
&#8220;Mrs. Captain,&#8221; even if the captain wasn&#8217;t as forehanded
as she&#8217;d seen men.</p>
<p>Even the elegant way in which he could do nothing
and yet diffuse an air of importance, was impressive to
her admiring soul. The clerical whiskers and the military
dress completed the conquest.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Huzzard, having a bit of native wisdom still
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
left, knew he was a man who would need managing,
and that the best way was not to let his opinion rule
her in all things; therefore, she only laughed cheerily at
his indignation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, captain, I can&#8217;t say but she did flare up about
the Indians, when you said they were all thieves and
paupers, stealing from the Government, and all that.
But then, by what she says, she has knowed some decent
ones in her time&mdash;friends of hers; an&#8217; you know any one
must say a good word for a friend. You&#8217;d do that yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe; I don&#8217;t say I wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;But I
do say, the friends would not be redskins. No, madame!
They&#8217;re no fit friends for a gentleman to cultivate; and
so I have told Dan. And if this girl owns such friends,
it shows plainly enough that the class she belongs to is
not a high one. Dan&#8217;s mother was a lady, Mrs. Huzzard!
She was my wife, madame! And it is a distress for me
to see any one received into our family who does not
come up to that same level. That is just the state of the
case, and I maintain my position in the matter; let Dan
take on all the temper he likes about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lady of the pies did not respond to his remarks
at once. She had an idea that she herself might fall
under the ban of Captain Leek&#8217;s discriminating eyes,
and be excluded from that upper circle of chosen humanity
to which he was born and bred. He liked her pies,
her flap-jacks, and even the many kinds of boiled dinners
she was in the habit of preparing and garnishing
with &#8220;dumplings.&#8221; So far as his stomach was concerned,
she could rule supreme, for his digestion was of
the best and her &#8220;filling&#8221; dishes just suited him. But
Lorena Jane Huzzard had read in the papers some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
romances of the &#8220;gentle folk&#8221; he was fond of speaking of
in an intimate way. The gentle folk in her kind of
stories always had titles, military or civil, and were generally
English lords and ladies; the villains, as generally,
were French or Italian. But think as she might over the
whole list, she could remember none in which the highbred
scion of blue blood had married either a cook or a
milliner. One might marry the milliner if she was very
young and madly beautiful, but Lorena Jane was neither.
She remembered also that beautiful though the milliner
or bailiff&#8217;s daughter, or housekeeper&#8217;s niece might be,
it was only the villain in high life who married her.
Then the marriage always turned out at last to be a
sham, and the milliner generally died of a broken heart.</p>
<p>So Mrs. Huzzard sighed and, with a thoughtful face,
stirred up the batter pudding.</p>
<p>Captain Leek had given her food for reflection of
which he was little aware, and it was quite a little while
before she remembered to answer his remarks.</p>
<p>&#8220;So Mr. Dan is showing temper, too, is he? Well&mdash;well&mdash;that&#8217;s
a pity. He&#8217;s a good boy, captain. I
wouldn&#8217;t waste my time to go against him, if I was you,
and there he is now. Good-morning, Mr. Dan! Come
right in! Breakfast over, but I&#8217;ll get you up a bite at
any time, and welcome. It does seem right nice for you
to be back in town again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton entered at her bidding, and smiled down from
his tall stature to the broad, good-natured face she
turned to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Breakfast! Why, I&#8217;m thinking more about dinner,
Mrs. Huzzard. I was up in the hills last night, and had
a camp breakfast before you city folks were stirring.
Where&#8217;s &#8217;Tana?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>A dubious sniff from Captain Leek embarrassed Mrs.
Huzzard for a moment. She thought he meant to
answer and hesitated to give him a chance. But the
sniff seemed to express all he wanted to say, and she
flushed a little at its evident significance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the matter now?&#8221; demanded the
younger man, impatiently, &#8220;where is she&mdash;do you
know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;why, yes&mdash;of course we do,&#8221; said Mrs. Huzzard
hurriedly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to leave you without an
answer&mdash;no, indeed. But the fact is, the captain is set
against something I did this morning, but I do hope you
won&#8217;t be. Whatever they know or don&#8217;t know in sussiety,
the girl was ignorant of it as could be when she
asked to go, and so was I when I let her. That&#8217;s the
gospel truth, and I do hope you won&#8217;t have hard feeling
against me for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He came a step nearer them both, and looked keenly
from one to the other&mdash;even a little threateningly into
the watchful eyes of Captain Leek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let her go! What do you mean? Where&mdash;Out
with it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, it was on the river she went, in one of
them tiltuppy Indian boats that I&#8217;m deathly afraid of.
But Mr. Lyster, he did promise faithfully he&#8217;d take good
care of her. And as she&#8217;d seemed a bit low-spirited this
morning, I thought it &#8217;ud do her good, and I part told
her to run along. And to think of its being improper
for them to go together&mdash;alone! Well, then, I never
did&mdash;that&#8217;s all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; and Overton drew a long breath as of relief
and laughed shortly. &#8220;Well, you are perfectly right,
Mrs. Huzzard. There is nothing wrong about it, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
don&#8217;t you be worried into thinking there is. Max Lyster
is a gentleman&mdash;didn&#8217;t you ever happen to know one,
dad? Heavens! what a sinner you must have been in
your time, if you can&#8217;t conceive two young folks going
out for an innocent boat ride. If any &#8217;sky pilot&#8217; drifts
up this way, I&#8217;ll explain your case to him&mdash;and ask for
some tracts. Why, man, your conscience must be a
burden to you! I understand, now, how it comes I find
your hair a little scarcer each time I run back to camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had seated himself, and leaning back, surveyed
the irate captain as though utterly oblivious of that
gentleman&#8217;s indignation, and then turned his attention
to Mrs. Huzzard, who was between two fires in her
regret that the captain should be ridiculed and her joy
in Overton&#8217;s commendation of herself. The captain had
dismayed her considerably by a monologue on etiquette
while she was making the pies, and she had inwardly
hoped that the girl and her handsome escort would return
before Overton, for vague womanly fears had been
awakened in her heart by the opinions of the captain.
To be sure, Dan never did look at girls much, and he
was as &#8220;settled down&#8221; as any old man yet. The girl
was pretty, and there was a bit of mystery about her.
Who could tell what her guardian intended her for?
This question had been asked by Captain Leek. Dan
was very close-lipped about her, and his reticence had
intensified the mystery regarding his ward. Mrs. Huzzard
had seen wars of extermination started for a less
worthy reason than pretty Montana, and so she had done
some quiet fretting over the question until &#8217;Tana&#8217;s guardian
set her free from worries by his hearty words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you bother your precious head, or &#8217;Tana&#8217;s,
with ideas of what rules people live by in a society of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
the cities thousands of miles away,&#8221; he advised her. &#8220;It&#8217;s
all right to furnish guards or chaperons where people
are so depraved as to need them.&#8221;</p>
<p>This with a turn of his eyes to the captain, who was
gathering himself up with a great deal of dignity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-morning, Mrs. Huzzard,&#8221; he said, looking with
an unapproachable air across Dan&#8217;s tousled head. &#8220;If
my stepson at times forgets what is due a gentleman in
your house, do not fancy that I reflect on you in the
slightest for it. I regret that he entertains such ideas,
as they are totally at variance with the rules by which
he was reared. Good-morning, madame.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard clasped her hands and gazed with reproach
at Overton, but at the same time she could not
repress a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, he is good-natured to take it like that,
and speak so beautiful,&#8221; she exclaimed, admiringly; &#8220;and
you surely did try any man&#8217;s patience, Mr. Dan. Shame
on you!&#8221;</p>
<p>But Dan only laughed and held up his finger warningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll marry that man some day, if I don&#8217;t put a
stop to this little mutual admiration society I find here
on my return,&#8221; he said, and caught her sleeve as she tried
to pass him. &#8220;Now don&#8217;t you do it, Mrs. Huzzard. You
are too nice a woman and too much of a necessity to
this camp for any one man to build up a claim for you.
Just think what will happen if you do marry him! Why,
you&#8217;ll be my stepmother! Doesn&#8217;t the prospect frighten
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, stop your nonsense, Mr. Dan! I declare you do
try a body&#8217;s patience. You are too big to send to bed
without your supper, or I vow I&#8217;d try it and see if it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
would tame you any. The captain is surely righteous
mad.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let him attend to his postoffice instead of interfering
with your good cooking. Jim Hill said yesterday
he guessed the postoffice had moved to your hotel, and
the boys all ask me when the wedding is to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>She blushed with a certain satisfaction, but tossed her
head provokingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, you can just tell them it won&#8217;t be this
week, Mr. Dan Overton; so you can quit your plaguing.
Who knows but they may be asking the same about you,
if you keep fetching such pretty girls into camp? Oh,
I guess you don&#8217;t like bein&#8217; plagued any more than other
folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Overton&#8217;s smile had vanished at her words, and
a tiny wrinkle crept between his brows. But when she
commented on it, he recovered himself, and answered
carelessly:</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t think I will keep on bringing pretty girls
into camp&mdash;that is, I scarcely think it will grow into a
steady habit,&#8221; he said, and met her eyes so steadily that
she dismissed all idea of any heart interest in the girl.
&#8220;But I&#8217;d rather &#8217;Tana didn&#8217;t hear any chaff of that sort.
You know what I mean. The boys, or any one, is like
enough to joke about it at first; but when they learn
&#8217;for keeps,&#8217; that I&#8217;m not a marrying man, they&#8217;ll let up.
As she grows older, there&#8217;ll be enough boys to bother
her in camp without me. All I want is to see that she
is looked after right; and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m in here to talk
about this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, I&#8217;m right glad to help you all I can&mdash;which
ain&#8217;t much, maybe, for I never did have a sight
of schooling. But I can learn her the milliner trade&mdash;though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
it ain&#8217;t much use at the Ferry yet; but it&#8217;s always
a living, anyway, for a woman in a town. And as to
cookin&#8217; and bakin&#8217;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; they are all right; she will learn such things
easily, I think! But I wanted to ask about that cousin
of yours&mdash;the lady who, you said, wanted to come out
from Ohio to teach Indians and visit you. Is she coming?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she writes like it. She is a fine scholar, Lavina
is; but I kind o&#8217; let up on asking her to come after I
struck this camp, for she always held her head high, I
hear, and wouldn&#8217;t be noways proud of me as a relation,
if she found me doing so much downright kitchen work.
I hain&#8217;t seen her since she was grow&#8217;d up, you know,
and I don&#8217;t know how she&#8217;d feel about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she&#8217;s any good, she&#8217;ll think all the more of you
for having pluck to tackle any honest work that comes,&#8221;
said Overton, decidedly. &#8220;We all do&mdash;every man in the
settlement. If I didn&#8217;t, I wouldn&#8217;t be asking you to look
after this little girl, who hasn&#8217;t any folks&mdash;father or
mother&mdash;to look after her right. I thought if that lady
teacher would just settle down here, I would make it
worth her while to teach &#8217;Tana.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, that would be wise,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs.
Huzzard, delightedly. &#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;ll write her a letter this
very night. Or, no&mdash;not to-night,&#8221; she added, &#8220;for I&#8217;ll
be too busy. To-night the dance is to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What dance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, I clean forgot to tell you about that. But
it was Mr. Lyster planned it out after you left yesterday.
As he&#8217;s to go back East in a few days, he is to give a
supper and a dance to the boys, and I just thought if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
they were going to have it, they might as well have it
right and so it&#8217;s to be here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton twisted his hat around in silence for a few
moments.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does &#8217;Tana think of it?&#8221; he asked, at last.</p>
<p>&#8220;She? Why, land&#8217;s sakes! She&#8217;s tickled a heap over
it. Indeed, to go back to the commencement, I guess it
was to please her he got it up. At least, that&#8217;s the way
it looked to me, for she no sooner said she&#8217;d like to see
a dance with this crowd at the Ferry than he said there
should be one, and I should get up a supper. I tell you
that young chap sets store by that little girl of yours,
though she does sass him a heap. They&#8217;re a fine-looking
young couple, Mr. Dan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Dan evidently agreed, for he nodded his head absently,
but did not speak. He did not look especially
pleased over the announcement of the dance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I suppose she&#8217;s got to learn soon or late whom
to meet and whom to let alone here,&#8221; he said at last, in
a troubled way, &#8220;and she might as well learn now as
later. Yet I wish Max had not been in such a hurry.
And he promised to take good care of her on the river,
did he?&#8221; he added, after another pause. &#8220;Well, he&#8217;s a
good fellow; but I reckon she can guide him in most
things up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; answered Mrs. Huzzard, with promptness,
&#8220;I heard her say myself that she had never been
along this part of the Kootenai River before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not speaking of this
immediate locality. I mean that she has good general
ideas about finding ways, and trails, and means. She&#8217;s
got ideas of outdoor life that girls don&#8217;t often have, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
reckon. And if she can only look after herself as well
in a camp as she can on a trail, I&#8217;ll be satisfied.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard looked at him as he stared moodily out
of the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see how it is,&#8221; she said, nodding her head in a
kindly way. &#8220;Since she&#8217;s here, you&#8217;re afraid some of
the folks is most too rough to teach her much good.
Well, well, don&#8217;t you worry. We&#8217;ll do the best we can,
and that dead partner o&#8217; yours&mdash;her father, you know&mdash;will
know you do your best; and no man can do more.
I had a notion about her associates when I let her go out
on the river this morning. &#8216;Just go along,&#8217; thought I,
&#8216;if you get into the way of making company out of real
gentlemen, you&#8217;ll not be so like to be satisfied with them
as ain&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough,&#8221; Dan assented, cheerily. &#8220;You have
been doing a little thinking on your own account, Mrs.
Huzzard? That&#8217;s all right, then. I&#8217;ll know that you are
a conscientious care-taker, no matter how far out on a
trail I am. There&#8217;s another thing I wanted to say; it&#8217;s
this: Just you let her think that the help she gives you
around the house more than pays for her keeping, will
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course I will; and I&#8217;m willing enough to
take her company in change for boarding, if that&#8217;s all.
You know I didn&#8217;t want to take the money when you
did pay it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know; that&#8217;s all right. I want you to have the
money, only don&#8217;t let her know she is any bill of expense
to me. Understand! You see, she said something about
it yesterday&mdash;thought she was a trouble to me, or some
such stuff. It seemed to bother her. When she gets
older, we can talk to her square about such things. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
now, till she gets more used to the thought of being with
us, we&#8217;ll have to do some pious cheating in the matter.
I&#8217;ll take the responsibilities of the lies, if we have to tell
any. It&mdash;it seems the only way out, you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>He spoke a little clumsily, as though uttering a speech
prepared beforehand and by one not used to memorizing,
and he did not look at Mrs. Huzzard as he talked to
her.</p>
<p>But she looked at him and then let her hand fall kindly
on his shoulder. She had not read romances for nothing.
All at once she fancied she had found a romance
in the life of Dan Overton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I see, as plain as need be,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I see
that you&#8217;ve brought care for yourself with that little
mischief in her Indian dress; an&#8217; you take all the care
on your shoulders as though it was a blessed privilege.
And she&#8217;s never to know what she owes you. Well,
there&#8217;s my hand. I&#8217;m your friend, Dan Overton. But
don&#8217;t waste your days with too much care about this
new pet you&#8217;ve brought home. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got to
say. She&#8217;ll never think more of you for it. Girls don&#8217;t;
they are as selfish as young wolves.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h3>MRS HUZZARD&#8217;S SUSPICIONS.</h3>
</div>

<p>Overton sat silent and thoughtful for a little while
after Mrs. Huzzard&#8217;s words. Then he glanced up and
smiled at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve just been getting an idea of the direction your
fancies are taking,&#8221; he said mockingly, &#8220;and they&#8217;re
very pretty, but I reckon you&#8217;ll change them to oblige
me; what I&#8217;m doing for her is what I&#8217;d do for any other
child left alone. But as this child doesn&#8217;t happen to be
a boy, I can&#8217;t take it on the trail, and a ranger like me
is not fit to look after her, anyway. I think I told you
before, I&#8217;m not a marrying man, and she, of course,
would not look at me if I was; so what does it matter
about her thinking of me? Of course, she won&#8217;t&mdash;it
ain&#8217;t my intention. Even if she leaves these diggings
some day and forgets all about me, just as the young
wolves or wildcats do&mdash;well, what difference? I&#8217;ve
helped old bums all over the country, and never heard
or wanted to hear of them again, and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s more
worth one&#8217;s while to help a young girl. Now, you&#8217;re a
nice little woman, Mrs. Huzzard, and I like you. But if
you and I are to keep on being good friends, don&#8217;t you
speak like that about the child and me. It&#8217;s very foolish.
If she should hear it, she&#8217;d leave us some fine night, and
we&#8217;d never learn her address.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>Then he put on his hat, nodded to her, and walked out
of the door as though averse to any further discussion
of the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bums all over the country!&#8221; repeated Mrs. Huzzard,
looking after him darkly. &#8220;Well, Mr. Dan Overton, it&#8217;s
well for you that ward of yours, as you call her, wasn&#8217;t
near enough to hear that speech. And you&#8217;re not a
marrying man, are you? Well, well, I guess there&#8217;s
many a man and woman, too, goes through life and
don&#8217;t know what they might be, just because they never
meet with the right person who could help them to learn,
and you&#8217;re just of that sort. Not a marrying man!
Humph! When there&#8217;s not a better favored one along
this valley&mdash;that there ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>She fidgeted about the dinner preparations, filled with
a puzzled impatience as to why Dan Overton should thus
decidedly state that he was not one of the men to marry,
though all the rest of the world might fall into the
popular habit if they chose.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the natural ambition of creation,&#8221; she declared
in confidence to the dried peach-pie she was slipping
from the oven. &#8220;Of course, being as I&#8217;m a widow myself,
I can&#8217;t just make that statement to men folks promiscuous
like. But it&#8217;s true, and every man ought to
know it&#8217;s true, and why Dan Overton&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused in the midst of her soliloquy, and dropped
into the nearest chair, while a light of comprehension
illuminated her broad face.</p>
<p>&#8220;To think it never came in my mind before,&#8221; she ejaculated.
&#8220;That&#8217;s it! Poor boy! he&#8217;s had a girl somewhere
and she&#8217;s died, I suppose, or married some other
fellow; and that&#8217;s why he&#8217;s a bachelor at nearly thirty,
I guess,&#8221; she added, thoughtfully. &#8220;She must have died,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
and that&#8217;s why he never looks as gay or goes on larks
with the other boys. He just goes on a lone trail mostly,
Dan does. Even his own stepfather don&#8217;t seem to have
much knowledge about him. Well, well! I always did
feel that he had some sort of trouble lookin&#8217; out of them
dark eyes of his, and his words to-day makes it plain to
me all at once. Well, well!&#8221;</p>
<p>The pensive expression of her face, as it rested on her
fat hand, was evidence that Lorena Jane Huzzard had,
after all, found a romance in real life suited to her
fancy, and the unconscious hero was Dan Overton. Poor
Dan!</p>
<p>The grieving hero to whom her thoughts went out
was at that moment walking in a most prosaic, lazy
fashion down the main thoroughfare of the settlement.
The road led down to the Ferry from seemingly nowhere
in particular, for from the Ferry on both sides
of the river the road dwindled into mere trails that slipped
away into the wildernesses&mdash;trails traveled by few of
the white race until a few short years ago, and then only
by the most daring of hunters, or the most persevering
of the gold-seekers.</p>
<p>In the paths where gold is found the dwellings of man
soon follow, and the quickly erected shanties and more
pretentious buildings of Sinna Ferry had grown there
as evidence that the precious metals in that region were
no longer visionary things of the enthusiasts, but veritable
facts. The men who came to it along the water,
or over the inland trails, were all in some way connected
with the opening up of the new mining fields.</p>
<p>Overton himself had drifted up there as an independent
prospector, two years before. Then, when works
were got under way all along that river and lake region,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
when a reliable man was needed by the transfer company
to get specie to their men for pay-days, it was Overton
to whom was given the responsibility.</p>
<p>Various responsible duties he had little by little shouldered,
until, as Lyster said, he seemed a necessity to a
large area, yet he had not quite abandoned the dreams
with which he had entered those cool Northern lands.
Some day, when the country was more settled and transportation
easier, it was his intention to slip again up into
the mountains, along some little streams he knew, and
work out there in quietness his theories as to where the
gold was to be found.</p>
<p>Meantime, he was contented enough with his lot. No
vaulting ambition touched him. He was merely a ranger
of the Kootenai country, and was as welcome in the
scattered lodges of the Indians as he was in the camps
of the miners. He even wore clothes of Indian make,
perhaps for the novelty of them, or perhaps because the
buckskin was better suited than cloth to the wild trails
over which he rode. And if, at times, he drifted into
talk of existence beyond the frontier, and gave one an
idea that he had drunk of worldly life deep enough to
be tired of it, those times were rare; even Lyster had but
once known him to make reference to it&mdash;that one evening
after their ride along the falls of the Kootenai.</p>
<p>But however tired he might at some time have grown
of the life of cities, he was not at all too <i>blasé</i> to accommodate
himself to Sinna Ferry. If poor Mrs. Huzzard
had seen the very hearty drink of whisky with which he
refreshed himself after his talk with her, she would not
have been so apt to think of him with such pensive sympathy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span></p>
<p>The largest and most popular saloon was next door to
the postoffice, the care of which Dan had secured for his
stepfather, as the duties of it were just about as arduous
as any that gentleman would deign to accept. The mail
came every two weeks, and its magnitude was of the
fourth-class order. No one else wanted it, for a man
would have to possess some other means of livelihood
before he could undertake it, but the captain accepted it
with the attitude of a veteran who was a martyr to his
country. As to the other means of livelihood, that did
not cause him much troubled thought, since he had
chanced to fall in Dan&#8217;s way just as Dan was starting
up to the Kootenai country, and Dan had been the &#8220;other
means&#8221; ever since.</p>
<p>The captain watched Overton gulp down the &#8220;fire-water,&#8221;
while he himself sipped his with the appreciation
of a gentleman of leisure.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t use to drink so early in the day,&#8221; the captain
remarked, with a certain watchful malice in his
face. &#8220;Are your cares as a guardian wearing on your
nerves, and bringing a need of stimulants?&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton wheeled about as though to fling the whisky-glass
across at the speaker; but the gallant captain, perceiving
that he had overreached his stepson&#8217;s patience,
promptly dodged around the end of the bar, squatting
close to the floor. Overton, leaning over to look at him,
only laughed contemptuously, and set the glass down
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not worth the price of the glass,&#8221; he decided,
amused in spite of himself at the fear in the pale-blue
eyes. Even the flowing side-whiskers betrayed a sort
of alarm in their bristling alertness. &#8220;And if it wasn&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
that one good woman fancied you were true metal instead
of slag, I&#8217;d&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not complete the sentence, leaving the captain
in doubt as to his half-expressed threat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up there!&#8221; Dan suddenly exclaimed. &#8220;Now, you
think you will annoy me about that guardianship until
I&#8217;ll give it up, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; he said, more quietly, as the
captain once more stood erect, but in a wavering, uncertain
way. &#8220;Well, you&#8217;re mightily mistaken, and you
might as well end your childish interference right here.
The girl is as much entitled to my consideration as you
are&mdash;more! So if any one is dropped out of the family
circle, it will not be her. Do you understand? And if I
hear another word of your insinuations about her amusements,
I&#8217;ll break your neck! Two, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>This last was to the barkeeper, and had reference to
a half-dollar he tossed on the counter as payment for his
own drink and that of the captain; and again he stalked
into the street with his temper even more rumpled than
when he left Mrs. Huzzard&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Assuredly it was not a good morning for Mr. Overton&#8217;s
peace of mind.</p>
<p>Down along the river he came in sight of the cause
of his discontent, the most innocent-looking cause in
the world. She was teaching Lyster to paddle the canoe
with but one paddle, as the Indians do, and was laughing
derisively at his ineffectual attempts to navigate in
a straight line.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;promised&mdash;Mrs. Huzzard&mdash;you&#8217;d&mdash;take&mdash;care&mdash;of&mdash;me,&#8221;
she said, slowly and emphatically, &#8220;and a
pretty way you&#8217;re doing it. Suppose I depended on you
getting me in to shore for my dinner, how many hours
do you think I&#8217;d have to go without eating? Just about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
sixteen. Give me that paddle, and don&#8217;t upset the canoe
when you move.&#8221;</p>
<p>These commands Mr. Lyster obeyed with alacrity.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a clever little girl you are!&#8221; he said, admiringly,
as she sent the canoe skimming straight as a swallow
for the shore. &#8220;Now, Overton would appreciate your
skill at this sort of work&#8221;&mdash;and then he laughed a little&mdash;&#8220;much
more than he would your modeling in clay.&#8221;</p>
<p>A dark flush crept over her face, and her lips straightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t he look down on that sort of pottering
around?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;<i>He</i> isn&#8217;t the sort of man
who has time to waste on trifles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why that emphasis on the <i>he</i>?&#8221; asked her tormentor.
&#8220;Do you mean to insinuate that I do waste time on trifles?
Well, well! is that the way I get snubbed, because I grow
enthusiastic over your artistic modeling and your most
charming voice, Miss &#8217;Tana?&#8221;</p>
<p>She flashed one sulky, suspicious look at him, and
paddled on in silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a stormy shadow lurks somewhere back of
your eyes,&#8221; he continued, lazily. &#8220;One moment you are
all sugar and cream to a fellow, and the next you are
an incipient tornado. I think you might distribute your
frowns a little among the people you know, and not give
them all to me. Now, there&#8217;s Overton&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you talk about him,&#8221; she commanded, sharply.
&#8220;You do a lot of making fun about folks, but don&#8217;t you
go on making fun of him, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re trying to
do. If it&#8217;s <i>me</i>&mdash;pooh!&#8221; and she looked at him, saucily.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t care much what you think about me; but Dan&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Dan, then, happens to-day to be one of the saints
in your calendar, and plain mortals like myself must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
not take his name in vain&mdash;is that it? What a change
from this time yesterday!&mdash;for I don&#8217;t think you sent
him to the hills in a very angelic mood. And you!&mdash;well,
I found you with a clay Indian crumbled to pieces in your
destroying hands; so I don&#8217;t imagine Dan&#8217;s talk to you
left a very peaceful impression.&#8221;</p>
<p>He laughed at her teasingly, expecting to see her show
temper again, but she did not. She only bent her head
a little lower, and when she lifted it, she looked at him
with a certain daring.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was right, and I was silly, I guess. He was good&mdash;so
good, and I&#8217;m mostly bad. I was bad to him, anyway,
but I ain&#8217;t too much of a baby to say so. And if
he&#8217;s mad at me when he comes back, I&#8217;ll just pack my
traps and take another trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to Akkomi?&#8221; he asked, gaily. &#8220;Now, you know
we would not hear to that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It ain&#8217;t your affair, only Dan&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, excuse me for living on the same earth with you
and Dan! It is not my fault, you know. I suppose now,
if you did desert us, it would be to act as a sort of guardian
angel to the tribes along the river, turn into a whole
life-saving service yourself, and pick up the superfluous
reds who tumble into the rivers. I wondered for a whole
day why you made so strong a swim for so unimportant
an article.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His mother thought he was important,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;But I didn&#8217;t know he had a mother just then; all I
thought as I started for him was that he was so plucky.
He tried his little best to save himself, and he never said
one word; that was what I liked about him. It would
have been a pity to let that sort of a boy be lost.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You think a heap of that&mdash;of personal bravery&mdash;don&#8217;t
you? I notice you gauge every one by that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe I do. I know I hate a coward,&#8221; she said, indifferently.</p>
<p>Then, as the canoe ran in to the shore, she for the first
time saw Overton, who was standing there waiting for
them. She looked at him with startled alertness as his
eyes met hers. He looked like a statue&mdash;a frontier sentinel
standing tall and muscular with folded arms
and gazing with curious intentness from one to the other
of the canoeists.</p>
<p>In the bottom of the boat a string of fish lay, fine
speckled fellows, to delight the palate of an epicure. She
stooped and picking up the fish, walked across the sands
to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, Dan!&#8221; she said, with unwonted humility.
&#8220;They&#8217;re the best I could find, and&mdash;and I&#8217;m sorry enough
for being ugly yesterday. I&#8217;ll try not to be any more.
I&#8217;ll do anything you want&mdash;yes, I will!&#8221; she added, snappishly,
as he smiled dubiously, she thought unbelievingly.
&#8220;I&#8217;d&mdash;dress like a boy, and go on the trails with you, paddle
your canoe, or feed your horse&mdash;I would, if you like.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyster, who was following, heard her words, and
glanced at Overton with curious meaning. Overton met
the look with something like a threat in his own eyes&mdash;a
sort of &#8220;laugh if you dare!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t like,&#8221; Dan said, briefly, to poor &#8217;Tana, who
had made such a great effort to atone for ugly words
spoken to him the day before.</p>
<p>She said no more; and Lyster, walking beside her,
pulled one of her unruly curls teasingly, to make her look
at him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I tell you it was better to give your smiles to me
instead of to Overton?&#8221; he asked, in a bantering way, as
he took the string of fish. &#8220;I care a great deal more about
your good opinion than he does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;you&mdash;&#8221; she began, and shrugged her shoulders
for a silent finish to her thought, as though words were
useless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, <i>me</i>! Of course, me. Now, if you had offered to
paddle a canoe for me, I&#8217;d&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d loll in the bottom of the boat and let me,&#8221; she
flashed out. &#8220;Of course you would; you&#8217;re made just
that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sh&mdash;h, &#8217;Tana,&#8221; said Overton, while to himself he
smiled in an indulgent way, and thought: &#8220;That is like
youth; they only quarrel when there is a listener.&#8221; Then
turning to the girl, he said aloud:</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, &#8217;Tana, I want you to learn other things
besides paddling a canoe. Such things are all right for a
boy; but&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she agreed; but there was a resentful tone
in her voice. &#8220;And I guess I&#8217;ll never trouble you to do
squaw&#8217;s work for you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked squaw-like, but for her brown, curly hair,
for she still wore the dress Overton had presented to her
at the Kootenai village; and very becoming it was with its
fancy fringes and dots of yellow, green, and black beads.
Only the hat was a civilized affair&mdash;the work of Mrs.
Huzzard, and was a wide, pretty &#8220;flat&#8221; of brown straw,
while from its crown some bunches of yellow rosebuds
nodded&mdash;the very last &#8220;artificial&#8221; blossoms left of Sinna
Ferry&#8217;s first millinery store. The young face looked
very piquant above the beaded collar; not so pinched or
worn a face as when the men had first seen her. The one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
week of sheltered content had given her cheeks a fullness
and color remarkable. She was prettier than either man
had imagined she would be. But it was not a joyous,
girlish face even yet. There was too much of something
like suspicion in it, a certain watchful attention given to
the people with whom she came in contact; and this did
not seem to abate in the least. Overton had noticed it, and
decided that first night that she must have been treated
badly by people to have distrust come so readily to her.
He noticed, also, that any honest show of kindness soon
won her over; and that to Lyster, with his graceful little
attentions and his amused interest, she turned from the
first hour of their acquaintance as to some chum who was
in the very inner circle of those to whom her favor was
extended. Overton, hearing their wordy wars and noting
their many remarks of friendship, felt old, as though
their light enjoyment of little things made him realize the
weight of his own years, for he could no longer laugh with
them.</p>
<p>Looking down now at the clouded young face under
the hat, he felt remorsefully like a &#8220;kill-joy;&#8221; for she had
been cheery enough until she caught sight of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will never do squaw work for me again, little
squaw?&#8221; Dan questioned, banteringly. &#8220;Not even if I
asked you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never will ask me,&#8221; she answered, promptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, not even if I should get sick and need a
nurse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; and she surveyed him from head to foot with
pronounced unbelief. &#8220;<i>You&#8217;ll</i> never be sick. You&#8217;re
strong as a mountain lion, or an old king buffalo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; he agreed, and smiled slightly at the dubious
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
compliment. &#8220;But you know even the old king buffaloes
die sometime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Die? Oh, yes, in a fight, or something of that sort;
but they don&#8217;t need much medicine!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And even if you did,&#8221; said Lyster, addressing Overton,
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to give you fair warning you can&#8217;t depend on
&#8217;Tana, unless you mend your ways. She threatened to-day
to leave us, if you allow the shadow of your anger
to fall on her again. So take heed, or she will swim back
to Akkomi.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton looked at her sharply, and saw that back of
Lyster&#8217;s badinage there was something of truth.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221; he asked, reproachfully. &#8220;I did not know
I had been so bad a friend to you as that.&#8221;</p>
<p>But no answer was made to him. She was ashamed,
and she looked it. She was also angry at Lyster, and he
was made aware of it by a withering glance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now <i>I&#8217;m</i> in her bad books,&#8221; he complained; &#8220;but it
was only my fear of losing her that urged me to give you
warning. I hope she does not take revenge by refusing
me all the dances I am looking forward to to-night. I&#8217;d
like to get you, as her guardian, on my side, Overton.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl looked up, expectantly, and rested her slim
fingers on the arms of the two men.</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not be of much use, unless I had an invitation
myself to the dance,&#8221; Dan remarked, dryly; &#8220;mine has
evidently been delayed in the mail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like it?&#8221; said the girl, detecting the fact in
his slight change of tone. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want me to go to
dances?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What an idea!&#8221; exclaimed Lyster. &#8220;Of course, he is
not going to spoil our good time by objecting&mdash;are you,
Dan? I never thought of that. You see, you were away;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
but, of course, I fancied you would like it, too. I&#8217;ll write
you out a flourishing request for your presence, if that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t necessary; I&#8217;ll be there, I reckon. But why
should you think I mean to keep you from jollifications?&#8221;
he asked, looking kindly at &#8217;Tana. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get the idea
in your head that I&#8217;m a sort of &#8216;Bad Man from Roaring
River,&#8217; who eats a man or so for breakfast every day, and
all the little girls he comes across. No, indeed! I&#8217;ll
whistle for you to dance any time; so get on your war-paint
and feathers when it pleases you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prospect seemed to please her, for she walked closer
to him and looked up at him with more content.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyway, you ain&#8217;t like Captain Leek,&#8221; she decided.
&#8220;He&#8217;s the worst old baby! Why, he just said all sorts
of things about dances. Guess he must be a heavy swell
where he comes from, and where all the fandangoes are
got up in gilt-edged style. I&#8217;d like to spoil the gilt for
him a little. I will, too, if he preaches any more of his
la-de-da society rules to me. I&#8217;ll show him I&#8217;m a different
boy from Mrs. Huzzard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, what would you do?&#8221; asked Lyster. &#8220;He
wouldn&#8217;t trust himself in a boat with you, so you can&#8217;t
drown him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t want to. Huh! I wouldn&#8217;t want to be lynched
for <i>him</i>. All I&#8217;d like to hit hard would be his good
opinion of himself. I could, too, if Dan wouldn&#8217;t object.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can, you&#8217;re a wonder,&#8221; remarked Dan. &#8220;And
I&#8217;ll give you license to do what I confess I can&#8217;t. But
I think you might take us into your confidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>This she would not do, and escaped all their questions,
by taking refuge in Mrs. Huzzard&#8217;s best room, and much
of her afternoon was spent there under that lady&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
surveillance, fashioning a party gown with which to astonish
the natives. For Mrs. Huzzard would not consent to her
appearing in the savageness of an Indian dress, when the
occasion was one of importance&mdash;namely, the first dance
in the settlement held in the house of a respectable woman.</p>
<p>And as &#8217;Tana stitched, and gathered, and fashioned
the dress, according to Mrs. Huzzard&#8217;s orders, she fashioned
at the same time a little plan of her own in which
the personality of Captain Leek was to figure.</p>
<p>If Mrs. Huzzard fancied that her silent smiles were in
anticipation of the dancing festivities, she was much mistaken.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<h3>A GAME OF POKER.</h3>
</div>

<p>Mr. Max Lyster, in his hasty plans for an innocent
village dance, had neglected to make allowance for a certain
portion of the inhabitants whose innocence was not
of the quality that allowed them to miss anything, no matter
who was host. They would shoot the glass out of
every window in a house, if the owner of the house should
be in their bad books for any trifling slight, and would
proceed to &#8220;clean out&#8221; any establishment where their own
peculiar set was ignored.</p>
<p>There were, perhaps, seven or eight women in the place
who were shown all respect by men in general. They
were the wives and daughters of the city fathers&mdash;the first
of the &#8220;family folks&#8221; to give the stamp of permanency
to the little camp by the river. These ladies and their
husbands, together with the better class of the &#8220;boys,&#8221;
were the people whom Mr. Lyster expected to meet and
to partake of his hospitality in the cheery abode of Mrs.
Huzzard.</p>
<p>But Overton knew there were one or two other people
to consider, and felt impatient with Lyster for his impulsive
arrangements. Of course, &#8217;Tana could not know
and Mrs. Huzzard did not, but Lyster had at least been
very thoughtless.</p>
<p>The fact was that the well-ordered establishment of
Mrs. Huzzard was a grievance and a thorn in the side of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
certain womankind, who dwelt along the main street and
kept open drinking saloons seven days in the week. They
would have bought ribbons and feathers from her, and as
a milliner thought no more about her, or even if she had
opened a hotel, with a bar attached, they would have been
willing to greet her as a fellow worker, and all would have
had even chances. But her effrontery in opening an eating
house, where only water&mdash;pure or adulterated with tea
or coffee&mdash;was drunk&mdash;Well, her immaculate pretensions,
to use the vernacular of one of the disgusted, &#8220;made
them sick.&#8221;</p>
<p>It may have been their dislike was made more pronounced
because of the fact that the more sober-minded
men turned gladly to the irreproachable abode of Mrs.
Huzzard, and the &#8220;bosses&#8221; of several &#8220;gangs&#8221; of workmen
had arranged with her for their meals. Besides,
the river men directed any strangers to her house;
whereas, before, the saloons had been the first point of
view from which travelers or miners had seen Sinna
Ferry. All these grievances had accumulated through the
weeks, until the climax was capped when the report went
abroad that a dance was to take place at the sickeningly
correct restaurant, and that only the <i>elité</i> of the settlement
were expected to attend.</p>
<p>Thereupon some oaths had been exchanged in a desultory
fashion over the bars at Mustang Kate&#8217;s and Dutch
Lena&#8217;s; and derisive comments made as to Mrs. Huzzard
and her late charge, the girl in the Indian dress. Some
of the boys, who owned musical instruments&mdash;a banjo and
a mouth organ&mdash;were openly approached by bribery to
keep away from the all too perfect gathering, so that there
might be a dearth of music. But the boys with the musical
instruments evaded the bribes, and even hinted aloud
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
their desire to dance once anyway with the new girl of
the curly hair and the Indian dress.</p>
<p>This decision increased somewhat the muttering of the
storm brewing; and when Dutch Lena&#8217;s own man indiscreetly
observed that he would have to drop in line, too,
if all the good boys were going, then indeed did the
cyclone of woman&#8217;s wrath break over that particular
branch of Hades. Lena&#8217;s man was scratched a little with
a knife before quiet was restored, and there had been
some articles of furniture flung around promiscuously;
also some violent language.</p>
<p>Overton divined somewhat of all this, knowing as he
did the material of the neighborhood, though no actual
history of events came to his ears. And &#8217;Tana, presenting
herself to his notice in all the glory of her party dress,
felt her enthusiasm cool as he looked at her moodily. He
would have liked to shut her away from all the vulgar
gaze and comment he knew her charming face would win
for her. His responsibilities as a guardian forced on him
so many new phases of thought. He had never before
given the social side of Sinna Ferry much consideration;
but he thought fast and angrily as he looked down on the
slim, girlish, white-draped figure and the lovely appealing
face turned upward to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like it&mdash;you don&#8217;t think it is pretty?&#8221; she
asked, and her mouth was a little tremulous. &#8220;I tried
so hard. I sewed part of it myself, and Mrs. Huzzard
said&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyster arose from a seat by the window. He had entered
the room but a moment before, and now lounged
toward her with critical eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Huzzard said you were enchanting in your new
gown&mdash;is not that it?&#8221; he asked, and then frowned at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
Overton in a serio-comic way. &#8220;And lives there a man
with soul so dead that he cannot perceive the manifold
beauties arranged for his inspection? Well, you know I
told you I appreciate you much more than he will ever
do; so&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What nonsense you are talking!&#8221; said Overton, irritably.
&#8220;Of course, the dress is all right. I don&#8217;t know
much about such things, though; so my opinion is not
worth much. But I don&#8217;t think little girls should be told
so much of their charms, Lyster. They are too likely to
be made think that prettiness is the only thing worth living
for.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled at &#8217;Tana to soften the severity of his speech;
but she was not looking at him just then, and so missed
the softening accompaniment. She felt it was herself
who was taken to task instead of Lyster, and stood with
drooped, darkening face until the door closed behind
Overton.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is your fault,&#8221; she burst out. &#8220;He&mdash;he might
have thought it was nice, if you hadn&#8217;t been here with
your fool speeches. You just go around laughing at
everything, Mr. Max Lyster, and you&#8217;re just as empty
as that china cat on the mantel, and it&#8217;s hollow. I&#8217;d like
to hit you sometimes when you say your nice, tantalizing
words&mdash;that&#8217;s what <i>I&#8217;d</i> like to do; and maybe some day
I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if you did,&#8221; he agreed, and
stepped back out of range of her clenched brown hands.
&#8220;Whew! what a trial you&#8217;d be to a guardian who had
nerves. You are spoiling your pretty face with that satanic
expression. Now, why should you make war on
me? I&#8217;m sure I am one of your most devoted servants.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are your own devoted servant,&#8221; she retorted,
&#8220;and you&#8217;ll never be any other person&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, I&#8217;m not so sure of that,&#8221; he said, and
looked at her smilingly. All her anger did not keep him
from seeing what a wondrous difference all that white,
billowy lawn made in the girl whom he had taken for a
squaw that first day when he saw her swimming the
Kootenai.</p>
<p>She looked taller, slighter, with such lovable curves in
the girlish form, and the creamy neck and arms gleaming
through the thin material. No ornaments or ribbons
broke the whiteness of her garb&mdash;nothing but the Indian
belt of beads that Overton had given her, and in it were
reddish tints and golden brown the color of her hair.</p>
<p>To be sure, the cheeks were a little tanned by the
weather, and the little hand was browner than need be
for beauty; but, for all that, he realized, as Overton had
seemingly not done, that the girl, when dressed as dainty
girlhood should be, was very pretty, indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am willing to sign myself your bond slave from
this hour, if that will lessen your anger against me,&#8221; he
protested. &#8220;Just think, I leave Sinna Ferry to-morrow.
How shall I do penance until then?&#8221;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;&#8216;It may be for years, and it may be forever,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Then why art thou silent, O voice of my heart?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>She pouted and frowned a little at his warbling, though
a smile eventually touched her lips, and speculation shone
in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I <i>will</i> make you do penance,&#8221; she declared, &#8220;and right
now, too. I haven&#8217;t any money, but I&#8217;ll put up my moccasins
against five dollars in a game of poker.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;play poker?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; she said briefly, and her eyes sparkled; &#8220;I&#8217;ll
play you and ask no favors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your moccasins are not worth five.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not. Call it two-fifty then and promise me two
hands at that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How sure you are to win!&#8221; he laughed, well pleased
that she was diverted from her quick displeasure. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
call it five against the moccasins. Here are the cards.
And what am I to do with those little moccasins, even if
I do win them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll take care of the moccasins!&#8221; she said, easily.
&#8220;I guess they&#8217;ll not trouble you much, Mr. Lyster. Cut
for deal?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded, and they commenced their game there alone
in Mrs. Huzzard&#8217;s most respectable <i>café</i>. Mrs. Huzzard
herself did not approve of card playing. No one but Captain
Leek had, as yet, been allowed that privilege. His
playing she had really begun to look upon as almost
moral in its effects, since he pursued it as the most innocent
of pastimes, never betting more than a few dimes,
and since it secluded him effectually from the roaring lion
of iniquity to which so many men fell victims in the lively
little settlement. But &#8217;Tana, knowing that card playing
by a girl would not be a thing within Mrs. Huzzard&#8217;s understanding,
glanced warily at the door leading to the second
floor of the establishment and comforted herself that
the mistress of the domain was yet employed by her toilet
for the evening.</p>
<p>&#8217;Tana dealt, and did it so deftly that Lyster looked
at her in surprise, even irritation. What business had
she touching the bits of pasteboard like that&mdash;like some
old gambler. Such a slight slip of a thing, with all the
beauty of early youth in her face, and all the guilelessness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
of a vestal in the pure white of her garb. He fancied he
would have felt different if he had seen her playing cards
in that Indian dress; it would not have brought such a
discord with it. And it was not merely that she played,
but it was the way she played that brought vexation to
him&mdash;that careless, assured handling of the cards. It
seemed almost professional,&mdash;it seemed&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just take that little five,&#8221; remarked his opponent
easily, and spread out the cards before him. &#8220;I know
what you&#8217;ve got, and it won&#8217;t touch this flush, and if
you play again I&#8217;d advise you to gather your wits and not
play so wild&mdash;that is, if you want to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stared at her in astonishment. It was quite true&mdash;while
his thoughts had been with her personality and her
incongruous occupation, her thoughts had been centered
very decidedly on the points of the game. She, at least,
had not played &#8220;wild.&#8221; A doubt even came into his mind,
as to whether she played honestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I cared about winning,&#8221; he answered,
&#8220;I&#8217;d rather have given you the stakes than to have had
you play for them that way&mdash;yes, &#8217;Tana, double the
stakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, would you?&#8221; she asked, with saucy indifference.
&#8220;Well, I ain&#8217;t asking favors. I guess I can win all I
want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt you can,&#8221; he assented, gravely. &#8220;But as
young ladies do not generally depend on their skill with
cards to earn their pocket money, I&#8217;m afraid Overton
would have a lecture ready for you, if he learned of your
skill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him,&#8221; she said, recklessly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve tried to be good,
and tried to be nice, and&mdash;and even pretty,&#8221; she added,
touching the dainty sleeve and skirt of her dress, &#8220;but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
what use is it? He just stands off and stares at me, and
even speaks sharp as if he&#8217;s sorry he ever brought me
down here. I didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d be like that. He was
nicer in Akkomi&#8217;s village; and now&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She hesitated, and, seeing that Lyster&#8217;s eyes were
watching her attentively, she laughed in a careless way,
and curled the five-dollar bill around her finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;So I might as well be bad, don&#8217;t you see? and I&#8217;m
going to be, too. I want this five dollars to gamble with,
and for nothing else in the world. I&#8217;m going to get square
with some one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which means you are going to worry some one else,
just because Overton has annoyed you,&#8221; decided Lyster.
&#8220;That is a woman&#8217;s idea of retaliation, I believe. Am I
the selected victim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you&#8217;re not, or I wouldn&#8217;t have told you. All
I wanted of you was to give me a start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly; your frankness is not very flattering; but, in
spite of it, I&#8217;d like to give you a start in a different way&mdash;toward
a good school, for instance. How would you like
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at him for a moment suspiciously, she was
so used to raillery from him; then she answered briefly:</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are not my guardian, Mr. Max Lyster.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you prefer card playing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t. I&#8217;d like it, but my income can&#8217;t cover
such luxuries, and I have booked myself to play for a
time this evening, if I can get the man I want to play
with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is what you must not do,&#8221; he said, hastily.
&#8220;With Overton or myself, of course, a game would not
do you any special harm; but you simply must not indulge
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
in such pastime with this promiscuous gathering of people&mdash;of
men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t men&mdash;it&#8217;s only one man I want to play&mdash;do
you see?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I might if I knew who it was; but you don&#8217;t know any
men here but Dan and me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I do, too. I know Captain Alphonso Leek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps, but&mdash;&#8221; Lyster smiled, and shook his head
dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;But he won&#8217;t play with me, because he don&#8217;t like me;
that&#8217;s what you would say, if you were not too polite&mdash;isn&#8217;t
it? He doesn&#8217;t approve of me, and can&#8217;t understand
why I&#8217;m on the face of the earth, and especially why Dan
should take any responsibility but Captain Leek on his
hands. Huh! Can&#8217;t I see? Of course I do. I heard him
call me <i>&#8216;that&#8217;</i> this morning. And so, I want to play a
game of poker with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked impishly at him from under her brows, and
twirled the money.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you be a messenger of peace and fix the game
for me?&#8221; she asked, insinuatingly. &#8220;You know you promised
to do penance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I forswear all rash promises for the future,&#8221; he
declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you did promise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll keep my word, since you are such a little
Shylock. And if it is only the captain&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed after he had gone out, and sat there
shuffling the cards and building them into various forms.
She was thus employed when Overton again passed the
window and entered the room ere she could conceal them.
He observed her attempt to do so and smiled indulgently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Playing with the cards, are you?&#8221; he asked, in a careless
way. &#8220;They are expensive toys sometimes. But
I&#8217;ll teach you &#8217;seven-up&#8217; some day; it&#8217;s an easy game.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it?&#8221; she said; but did not look up at him. His indifference
to the pretty dress had not yet ceased to annoy
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. And see here, &#8217;Tana! I forgot to give you a
present I brought you a little while ago. It&#8217;s a ring a
fellow from the upper lake region worried me into buying,
as he was dead broke. He bought it from an Indian
up near Karlo. Queer for an Indian to have, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Near Karlo?&#8221; she said, and reached out her hand
for it.</p>
<p>There was a strange look on her face, a strange choking
sound in her throat. He noticed it, and his voice was
very kindly as he spoke again.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t like even to hear of that region, do you?
You must have been very miserable somewhere up there.
But never mind, little girl; we&#8217;ll try to forget all that.
And if the ring fits you, wear it, no matter what country
it comes from.&#8221;</p>
<p>She tried to thank him, but the words would not come
easily, and her outstretched hand in which the ring lay
was tremulous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; he said hastily, afraid, no doubt,
she was going to cry, as he had seen her do before at
kind words. &#8220;Never mind about the thanks. If you care
to wear it, that&#8217;s all that&#8217;s necessary; though a snake ring
is not the prettiest of ornaments for a girl. It fits,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it fits,&#8221; she returned, and slipped it on her finger.
&#8220;It is very nice,&#8221; but she shivered as with cold, and her
hand shook.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span></p>
<p>It was curious enough to attract notice anywhere, a
silver and a gold snake twined together with their heads
meeting, and in the flattened gold head, eyes of garnet
gleamed, while the silver head had eyes of emerald. Not
a girlish looking ornament, surely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wear it,&#8221; she said, and dropped the hand to her
side. &#8220;But don&#8217;t tell the rest where it came from. I
may want to tease them.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<h3>THE DANCE.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it lovely, Ora?&#8221; and &#8217;Tana danced past Ora Harrison,
the doctor&#8217;s pretty daughter, as if her feet had
wings to them. And as Ora&#8217;s bright face smiled an
answer, it was clear that the only two young girls in the
settlement were enjoying Lyster&#8217;s party to the full.</p>
<p>For it was a pronounced success. Every &#8220;boy&#8221; invited
was there in as much of festive outfit as circumstances
would allow. All the &#8220;family&#8221; people were there. And
the presence of Doctor Harrison&mdash;the only &#8220;professional&#8221;
man in the town&mdash;and his wife and daughter gave a
stamp of select society to the gathering in Mrs. Huzzard&#8217;s
rooms.</p>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard beamed with pleasure at the great success
of it all. She would have liked to dance, too, and
refused most unwillingly when Lyster tried to persuade
her. But a supercilious glance from the captain made her
refusal decided. The doubt as to whether ladies in
&#8220;sussiety&#8221; ever did dance after forty years, and one hundred
and sixty-three pounds weight, deterred her. Now,
if the captain had asked her to dance, she would have been
more assured.</p>
<p>But the captain did not; and, after a while, he was
not to be seen. He had vanished into the little back sitting
room, and she was confident he was engaged in his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
innocent pastime of a friendly game of cards with the
doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and dance with &#8217;Tana, or that nice little girl of the
doctor&#8217;s,&#8221; she said to Lyster, when he was trying to inveigle
her into a quadrille&mdash;&#8220;that&#8217;s the sort of partner for
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But &#8217;Tana has disappeared mysteriously; and as Miss
Ora is &#8217;bespoke,&#8217; I can&#8217;t dance with her unless I want a
duel with her partner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana disappeared! Well, now, I haven&#8217;t seen her
for two dances,&#8221; said Mrs. Huzzard, looking around
searchingly, &#8220;though I never missed her till this minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; said a voice at her elbow; &#8220;but
is it the&mdash;the young lady with the white dress you are
looking for?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; answered Mrs. Huzzard, and turned
around to face the speaker, who was an apologetic-looking
stranger with drab-colored chin whiskers, and a
checkered shirt, and a slight impediment in his speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, ma&#8217;am, I saw her go into that room there quite
a spell ago,&#8221; and he nodded toward the back sitting room.
&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t passed out again, as I&#8217;ve seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as Mrs. Huzzard smiled on him in a friendly
way, he ventured further:</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a very pretty girl, as any one can see. Might I
ask her name?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! Her name is Rivers&mdash;Miss Tana Rivers,&#8221;
said Mrs. Huzzard. &#8220;You must be a stranger in the settlement?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am, I am. My name is Harris&mdash;Jim Harris.
I come down from the diggings with Mr. Overton this
morning. He allowed it would be all right for me to
step inside, if I wanted to see the dancing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span></p>
<p>&#8220;To be sure it is,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Huzzard, heartily. &#8220;His
friends are our friends, and civil folks are always right
welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank, you, ma&#8217;am; you&#8217;re kind, I&#8217;m sure. But we
ain&#8217;t just friends, especial. Only I had business in his
line, so we picked up acquaintance and come into camp
together; and when I saw the pretty girl in white, I did
think I&#8217;d like to come in a spell. She looks so uncommon
like a boy I knew up in the &#8217;big bend&#8217; country. Looks
enough like him to be a twin; but he wasn&#8217;t called Rivers.
Has&mdash;has this young lady any brothers or cousins up
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, as for cousins, they are far out, and we
hain&#8217;t ever talked about them; but as for brothers or
sisters, father or mother, that she hasn&#8217;t got, for she told
me so. Her pa and Mr. Dan Overton they was partners
once; and when the pa died he just left his child to the
partner&#8217;s care; and he couldn&#8217;t have left her to a squarer
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what report says of him,&#8221; conceded the
stranger, watching her with guarded attention. &#8220;Then
Mr. Overton&#8217;s partner hasn&#8217;t been dead long?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no&mdash;not very long; not long enough for the child
to get used to talking of it to strangers, I guess; so we
don&#8217;t ask her many questions about it. But it troubles
her yet, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course&mdash;of course; such a pretty little girl, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the two fell into quite a pleasant chat, and it was
not until he moved away from beside her, to make room
for the doctor&#8217;s wife, that Mrs. Huzzard observed that
one arm hung limply beside him, and that one leg dragged
a little as he walked. He was a man who bore paralysis
with him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>She thought, while he was talking to her, that he
looked like a man who had seen trouble. A weary, drawn
look was about his eyes. She had seen dissipated men
who looked like that; yet this stranger seemed in no ways
a man of that sort. He was so quiet and polite; and
when she saw the almost useless limbs, she thought she
knew then what that look in his face meant.</p>
<p>But there were too many people about for her to study
one very particularly, so she lost sight of the stranger,
Harris, and did not observe that he had moved near the
door of the sitting room, or that the door was open.</p>
<p>But it was; and just inside of it Lyster stood watching,
with a certain vexation, a game of cards played there.
The doctor had withdrawn, and was looking with amusement
at the two players&mdash;&#8217;Tana and Captain Leek. The
captain was getting the worst of it. His scattered whiskers
fairly bristled with perplexity and irritation. Several
times he displayed bad judgment in drawing and
discarding, because of his nervous annoyance, while she
seemed surprisingly skillful or lucky, and was not at all
disturbed by her opponent&#8217;s moods. She looked smilingly
straight into his eyes, and when she exhibited the last winning
hand, and the captain dashed his hand angrily into
the pack, she waited for one civil second and then swept
the stakes toward her.</p>
<p>&#8220;What! Don&#8217;t you want to play any more, captain?&#8221;
she asked, maliciously. &#8220;I would really like to have another
dance, yet if you want revenge&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and dance by all means,&#8221; he said, testily. &#8220;When
I want another game of poker, I&#8217;ll let you know, but I
must say I do not approve of such pastime for young
ladies.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>&#8220;None of us would, if in your place, captain,&#8221; laughed
the doctor. &#8220;And, for my part, I am glad I did not play
against her luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>The captain mumbled something about a difference between
luck and skill, while &#8217;Tana swept the money off the
table and laughed&mdash;not a pleasant laugh, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four!&mdash;twenty dollars&mdash;that is
about a dollar a minute, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she asked provokingly.
&#8220;Well, captain, I guess we are square up to to-night, and
if you want to open another account, I&#8217;m ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke with the dash and recklessness of a boy.
Lyster noticed it again, and resented it silently. But
when she turned, she read the displeasure in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s you, is it?&#8221; she inquired airily. &#8220;Is it time
for our dance? You see, the captain wanted some amusement,
and, as the doctor was nearly asleep over the cards,
I came in and helped them out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beautifully,&#8221; agreed the doctor.</p>
<p>But Lyster borrowed no cheeriness from their smiles.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is our dance,&#8221; Lyster observed. &#8220;And if
you will come&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certain,&#8221; she said, with a nod; but at the door she
paused. &#8220;Won&#8217;t you keep this money for me?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve no pocket. And just put a five in a locked pocket
&#8217;for keeps,&#8217; please; I owe it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To me? You won that five.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t; I cheated you,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Keep
it, please do.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pushed the money into his hand. One piece of it
fell and rolled to the feet of the stranger, who leaned
carelessly against the doorway, but in such a position that
he could easily see into the sitting room.</p>
<p>He stooped and picked up the money.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yours, miss?&#8221; he said, courteously, and she smilingly
reached out her hand for it&mdash;the hand on which Overton&#8217;s
gift, the strange ring, glittered.</p>
<p>The paralytic stranger barely repressed an exclamation
as he noticed it, and from it his eyes went swiftly, questioningly,
to the girl&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s mine,&#8221; she said, with a nod of thanks. Then
she smiled a little as she saw where his attention was
given. &#8220;Are you wondering if the snakes you see are
the result of odd drinks? Well, they are not; they are
of metal and won&#8217;t hurt you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beg pardon, miss. Guess I did look at your pretty
ring sharp; and it is enough to make a man shake if he&#8217;s
been drinking. But a little drink will do me a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then Lyster and the girl passed on, the girl smiling at
the little exchange of words with the stranger. But Lyster
himself was anything but well pleased at the entire affair.
He resented the fact that he had found her there gambling,
that she had shown such skill, that she had turned to
the seedy-looking stranger and exchanged words, as men
might do, but as a girl assuredly should not do. All these
things disturbed him. Why, he could scarcely have told.
Only that morning she had been but a little half-savage
child, who amused him by her varying moods and sharp
speech. But to-night, in her graceful white gown, she
seemed to have grown taller and more womanly and winsome.
The glances and homage of the most acceptable
youths about revealed to him the fact that she was somewhat
more than the strong swimmer or clever canoeist.
She was deemed charming by others, in a very different
fashion than he had thought of her, and she appeared
rather too conscious of the fact. He fancied that she even
delighted in letting him see that others showed deference
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
to her, when he had only that day teased her as carelessly
as he would have teased a boy into a rage.</p>
<p>Then to stop and jest like that with the insignificant
stranger by the door! Mr. Lyster said a bad word in his
mind, and decided that the presuming masculinity of the
settlement would be allowed few chances for favors
the remainder of the evening. He intended to guard her
himself&mdash;a formidable guard for the purpose, as a man
would need a good deal of self-reliance to try for favor
if so handsome a personality as Lyster&#8217;s was an opponent.</p>
<p>But the rather shabby stranger, standing by the inner
door, scarcely noticed the noticeable young fellow. All
his attention was given to the girl who had spoken to
him so frankly. She passed on and did not observe his
excessive interest. But his eyes lighted up when he heard
her voice speaking to him, and his face flushed with
color as he stroked his beard with his well hand and gazed
after her.</p>
<p>&#8220;So this is where the trail begins, is it?&#8221; he whispered
to the trembling hand at his lips. &#8220;Well, I would have
looked for it many another place before commencing with
a partner of Mr. Dan Overton&mdash;law-and-order man. He
must have gulled this whole territory beautifully to have
them swear by him as they do. And &#8217;Monte&#8217; is his <i>protégée</i>!
Well, Miss&mdash;or Mr. Monte&mdash;whichever it is&mdash;your
girl&#8217;s toggery is more becoming than the outfit I
saw you wear last; but though your hair is a little darker,
I&#8217;d swear to you anywhere&mdash;yes, and to the ring, too.
Well, I think I&#8217;ll rest my weary body in this &#8217;burgh&#8217; for
a few weeks to come. If the devil hasn&#8217;t helped his own,
and cheated me, this partner&mdash;Mr. &#8216;Rivers&#8217;&mdash;is yet alive
and in the flesh. If so, there is one place he will drift
sooner or later, and that is to this young gambler. And
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
then&mdash;then death will be no sham for him, for I will be
here, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>To &#8217;Tana&mdash;jubilant with her victory over her instinctive
antagonist, the captain&mdash;all the evening was
made for her pleasure, and she floated in the paradise of
sixteen years; and the world where people danced was
the only world worth knowing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will be good now&mdash;I can be as good as an angel
since I&#8217;ve got even with the captain.&#8221;</p>
<p>She whispered those words to Lyster, whose hand was
clasping hers, whose arm was about her waist, as they,
drifted around the rather small circle, to a waltz played
on a concertina and a banjo.</p>
<p>She looked up at him, mutely asking him to believe
her. Her desire for revenge satisfied, she could be a very
good girl now.</p>
<p>It was just then that Overton, who stood outside the
window, glanced in and saw her lovely upturned face&mdash;saw
the red lips move in some pouting protest, to which
Lyster smiled but looked doubtfully down at her. To
the man watching them from without, the two seemed
always so close&mdash;so confidential. At times he even wondered
if Lyster had not learned more than himself of
her life before that day at Akkomi&#8217;s camp.</p>
<p>All that evening Dan had not once entered the room
where they danced, or added in any way to their merry-making.
He had stood outside the door most of the time,
or sometimes rested a little way from it on a store box,
where he smoked placidly, and inspected the people who
gathered to the dance.</p>
<p>All the invited guests came early, and perfect harmony
reigned within. A few of the unsavory order of citizens
had sauntered by, as though taking note of the pleasures
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
from which they were excluded. But it was not until
almost twelve o&#8217;clock&mdash;just after Overton had turned
away from watching the waltz&mdash;that a pistol shot rang
out in the street, and several dancers halted.</p>
<p>Some of the men silently moved to the door, but just
then the door was opened by Overton, who looked in.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was only my gun went off by accident,&#8221; he said,
carelessly. &#8220;So don&#8217;t let me stampede the party. Go on
with your music.&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger, Harris, was nearest the door, and essayed
to pass out, but Overton touched him on the arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not just yet,&#8221; he said hurriedly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t come out or
others will follow, and there&#8217;ll be trouble. Keep them
in some way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the door closed. The concertina sobbed and
shrieked out its notes, and drowned a murmur of voices
on the outside. One man lay senseless close to the doorstep,
and four more men with two women stood a little
apart from him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If another shot is fired, your houses will be torn
down over your heads to-morrow,&#8221; said Overton, threateningly;
&#8220;and some of you will not be needing an earthly
habitation by that time, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fury! It is Overton!&#8221; muttered one of the men to
another. &#8220;They told us he wasn&#8217;t in this thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What for you care?&#8221; demanded the angry tones of a
Dutch woman. &#8220;What difference that make&mdash;eh? If so
be as we want to dance&mdash;well, then, we go in and dance&mdash;you
make no mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the men were not so aggressive. The most audacious
was the senseless one, who had fired the revolver
and whom Overton had promptly and quietly knocked
down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you men want any trouble of this sort,&#8221;
he remarked, and ignored the women entirely. &#8220;If you&#8217;ve
been told that I&#8217;m not in this, that&#8217;s just where some one
told you a lie; and if it&#8217;s a woman, you should know better
than to follow her lead. If these women get through
that door, it will be when I&#8217;m an angel. I&#8217;m doing you
all a good turn by not letting the boys in there know about
this. No religion could save you, if I turned them loose
on you; so you had better get away quiet, and quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men seemed to appreciate his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so,&#8221; mumbled one.</p>
<p>And as the other woman attempted a protest, one of
the men put his hand over her mouth, and, picking her
up bodily, walked down the street with her, she all the
time kicking and making remarks of a vigorous nature.</p>
<p>The humor of the situation appealed to the delicate
senses of her companions, until they laughed right
heartily, and the entire tone of the scene was changed
from a threat of battle to an excuse for jollity. The man
on the ground reeled upward to his feet with the help of
a shake from Overton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my gun?&#8221; he asked, sulkily.</p>
<p>Blood trickling from a cut brow compelled him to
keep one eye shut.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overton has it,&#8221; explained one of his friends. &#8220;Come
on, and don&#8217;t try another racket.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want my gun&mdash;it was him hit me,&#8221; growled the
wounded one, whose spirits had not been enlivened by
the spectacle the rest had witnessed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right&mdash;it was him,&#8221; agreed the other, darkly;
&#8220;and if it hadn&#8217;t been for breaking up the dance, I guess
he&#8217;d a-killed you. Come on. You left a ball in his
arm by the looks of things, and all he did was to knock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
you still. He may want to do more to-morrow. But as
you have no gun, you&#8217;d better wait till then.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door had been opened, and the light streamed out.
Men talked in a friendly, jovial fashion on and about the
doorstep. They saw the forms moving away in the
shadows, but no sign of disturbance met them.</p>
<p>Overton stood looking in the window at the dancers.
The waltz was not yet finished, and &#8217;Tana and Lyster
drifted past within a few feet of him. The serenity of
their evening had not been disturbed. Her face held all
of joyous content&mdash;so it seemed to the watcher. She
laughed as she danced; and hearing the music of her
high, girlish tones, he forgot for a time the stinging little
pain in his arm, until his left hand, thrust into his coat
pocket, slowly filled with blood. Then Dan turned to the
man nearest him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Doctor Harrison is still in there, would you do me
the favor of asking him to come outside for a few minutes?&#8221;
he asked, and the man addressed stepped closer.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a back way into the house. Hadn&#8217;t you better
just step in that way, and have him fix you up? He&#8217;s
in the back room, alone, smoking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton turned with an impatient exclamation, and a
sharp, questioning look. It was the half-paralyzed
stranger&mdash;Harris.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I ain&#8217;t interfering!&#8221; he said, amiably. &#8220;But as
I slipped out through the back door before your visitors
left, I dropped to the fact that you had some damage done
to that left arm. Yes, I&#8217;ll carry any message you like
to your doctor, for I like your nerve. But I must say it&#8217;s
thankless work to stand up as a silent target for cold lead,
just so some one else may dance undisturbed. Take an
old man&#8217;s advice, sonny, do some of the dancing yourself.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<h3>THE STRANGER&#8217;S WARNING.</h3>
</div>

<p>That one festive night decided the immediate future
of &#8217;Tana. All her joy in it did not prevent a decision that
it should be the last in her experience, for a year to come,
at least.</p>
<p>It was Lyster who broached the subject, and Overton
looked at him closely while he talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; he decided, at last; &#8220;a school is the
easiest path out of this jungle, I reckon. I thought of a
school, but didn&#8217;t know where&mdash;I&#8217;m not posted on such
things. But if you know the trail to a good one, we&#8217;ll
fix it. She has no family folks at all, so&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to ask, if it&#8217;s allowable&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me about her people,&#8221; said the other,
quickly; &#8220;she wouldn&#8217;t want me to talk of them. You see,
Max, all sorts get caught in whirlpools of one sort or
another, when ventures are made in a new country like
this, and often it&#8217;s a thoroughbred that goes under first,
while a lot of scrub stock will pull through an epidemic
and never miss a feed. Well, her folks belonged to the
list that has gone under&mdash;speculating people, you know,
who left her stranded when they started &#8217;over the range,&#8217;
and she&#8217;s sensitive about it&mdash;has a sort of pride, too, and
doesn&#8217;t want to be pitied, I guess. Anyway, I&#8217;ve promised
she sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be followed by any reminder of her misfortunes,
and I can&#8217;t go into details.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right; I&#8217;m not curious to know whether
her folks had a palace or a cabin to live in. But she has
brightness. I like her well enough to give up some
useless pastimes that are expensive, and contribute the
results to a school fund for her, if you say yes. But I
should like to know if her people belonged to the class
we call ladies and gentlemen&mdash;that is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton did not answer at once. His eyes were turned
toward his bandaged arm, and a little wrinkle grew between
his brows.</p>
<p>&#8220;The man is dead, and I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything
for me to say as to his gentlemanly qualities,&#8221; he said at
last. &#8220;He was a prospector and speculator, with an equal
amount of vice and virtue in him, I suppose; just about
like the rest of us. Her mother I never saw, but have
reason to think she was a lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you say every word of that as if they were drawn
from you with forceps,&#8221; said Lyster, cheerily. &#8220;Well,
I&#8217;ll not bother you about it again. But, you see, there is
a cousin of mine at the school I spoke of, and I wanted
to know because of that. It&#8217;s all right, though; my own
instincts would tell me she came of good stock. But even
good stock will grow wild, you know, if it doesn&#8217;t get
the right sort of training. You know, old fellow, I&#8217;m
downright in earnest about wanting to help you about
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know. You have, too,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
pointed out the school and all, and we see she can&#8217;t be
left here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not when you are ranging around the hills, and never
a man to take your place as a guard,&#8221; agreed Lyster. &#8220;I
feel about two years old ever since I heard of how you
kept annoyances from us last night while we were so
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
serenely unconscious of your trials. &#8217;Tana will scarcely
look at me this morning, for no reason but that I did not
divine the state of affairs and go to help you. That girl
has picked up so much queer knowledge herself that she
expects every one to be gifted with second sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he told, with a good deal of amusement, the
episode of the poker game and the discomfiture of the
captain.</p>
<p>Overton said little. He was not so much shocked or
vexed over it as Lyster had been, because he had lived
more among people to whom such pastimes were not
unusual.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I offered to teach her &#8217;seven-up,&#8217; because it was
easy,&#8221; he remarked grimly. &#8220;Yes, the school is best.
You see, even if I am on the ground, I&#8217;m not a fit guardian.
Didn&#8217;t I give her leave to get square with the
old man? While, if I&#8217;d been the right sort of a guardian,
she would have been given a moral lecture on the
sinfulness of revenge. I guess we&#8217;d better begin to talk
school right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I imagine she&#8217;ll object at first, through force of habit,
and protest that she knows enough for one girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she did not. She listened with wonder in her eyes,
and something of shamed contrition in her face, and
knew so well&mdash;so very well that she did not deserve it.
She had wanted&mdash;really wanted to vex him when she
played the cards, when she had danced past, and never
let on she saw him looking somberly in at the window
the night before. But in the light of morning and with
the knowledge of his wounded arm, all her resentment
was gone. She could scarcely speak even the words she
meant to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do that&mdash;go, I mean. It will cost so much,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
and I have no money. I can&#8217;t make any here, and&mdash;and
you are not rich enough to lend it to me, even if I could
pay it back some day, so&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind about the money; it will be got. I&#8217;m
to start up north of this soon, and this doesn&#8217;t seem a good
place to school you in, anyway. So, for a year or so,
you go to that school down in Helena. Max knows the
name of it; I forget. When you get all rigged out with an
education, and have a capital of knowledge, you can talk
then about the money and paying it, if it makes you feel
more comfortable. But just now you be a good little
girl; go down there with Max to the school, study hard,
so that if I drop into a chasm some night, or am picked
off by a bullet, you&#8217;ll have learned, anyway, how to look
after yourself in the right way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Mr. Max, then, that&#8217;s planning this, is it?&#8221;
she asked suddenly, and her face flushed a little&mdash;he must
have thought in anger, for he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;yes; that is&mdash;mostly. You see, &#8217;Tana, I&#8217;ve
drifted out from the ways of the world while Max has
kept up with them. So he proposed&mdash;well, no matter
about the plan. I&#8217;m to suggest it to you, and as it&#8217;s no
loss and all gain to you, I reckon you&#8217;ll be sensible enough
to say yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; she answered, quietly; &#8220;it is very kind of
you both to be so good to me, for I haven&#8217;t been good to
you&mdash;to either of you, I&#8217;m sorry&mdash;I&mdash;maybe I&#8217;ll be better
when I come back&mdash;and&mdash;maybe I can pay you some
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? Oh, you won&#8217;t owe me anything, and I reckon
you&#8217;d better not make plans about coming back here!
The books and things you learn will likely turn you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
toward other places&mdash;finer places. This is all right for
men who have money to make; but you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming back here,&#8221; she said, nodding her head
emphatically. &#8220;Maybe not for always&mdash;but I&#8217;ll come back
some time&mdash;I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was twisting her fingers in a nervous way, and, as
he watched her, he noticed that her little brown hands
were devoid of all ornament.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the ring?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Have you lost it already?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s here&mdash;in my pocket,&#8221; and she drew it out that
he might see. &#8220;I&mdash;I took it off this morning when I
saw you were shot. You&#8217;ll laugh, I suppose; but I
thought the snakes brought bad luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are superstitious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know! I&#8217;m not afraid very often; but
sometimes I think there are signs that are true. I&#8217;ve
heard old folks say so, and talk of things unlucky. I
took the ring off when I saw your arm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the arm was only scratched&mdash;not worth a thought
from a little girl like you,&#8221; he said; &#8220;and surely not
worth throwing off your jewelry for. But some day&mdash;some
day of good luck, I may find you a prettier ring&mdash;one
more like a girl&#8217;s ring, you know; one you can
wear and not be afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;m afraid, it isn&#8217;t for myself,&#8221; she said, with that
old, unchildlike look he had not seen in her eyes of late.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;m afraid of. Have you ever
heard of people who were &#8217;hoodoos&#8217;? I guess you have.
Well, sometimes I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m just that&mdash;like the snakes
in that ring. I&#8217;m afraid I bring bad luck to people&mdash;people
I like. It isn&#8217;t the harm to me that ever frightens
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
me. I guess I can fight that; but no one can fight a
&#8217;hoodoo,&#8217; I guess; and your arm&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, see here! Wake up, &#8217;Tana, you&#8217;re dreaming!
Who put that cussed nonsense into your head? &#8216;Hoodoo!&#8217;
Pshaw! I will have patience with you in anything but
that. Did any one look at you last night as if you were
a &#8217;hoodoo&#8217;? Here comes Max; we&#8217;ll ask him.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she did not smile at their badinage.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in earnest, and you think it only funny,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;Well, maybe you won&#8217;t always laugh at it. Men
who know a heap believe in &#8216;hoodoos.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not &#8217;hoodoos&#8217; possessed of the <i>tout ensemble</i> of
Miss Rivers,&#8221; objected Lyster. &#8220;You are simply trying
to scare us&mdash;me, out of the journey I hoped to make with
you to Helena. You are trying to evade a year of
scholastic training we have planned for you, and you
would like to prophesy that the boat will blow up or the
cars run off the track if you embark. But it won&#8217;t. You
will say good-by to your ogre of a guardian to-morrow.
You will be guarded by no less a personage than my immaculate
self to the door of your academy; from which
you will emerge, later on, with never a memory of &#8217;hoodoos&#8217;
in your wise brain; and you will live to a green old
age and make clay busts of us both when we are gray
haired. There! I think I&#8217;m a good healthy sort of a
prophet; and as a reward will you go with me to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With you? Then it is you who&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who has planned the whole brilliant scheme? Exactly&mdash;the
journey part of it at all events; and I&#8217;m not
so modest as our friend here. I&#8217;ll take the blame of my
share, and his, too, if he doesn&#8217;t speak up for himself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
Here comes your new friend, Dan. Where did you pick
him up?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the man Harris, and beside him was the captain.
They were talking with some animation of late Indian
raids to the westward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt if it was Indians at all who did the thieving,&#8221;
remarked Harris; &#8220;there are always a lot of scrub
whites ready to take advantage of war signals, and do
devilment of that sort, made up as reds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;some say so! That man Holly used to get
the credit of that sort of renegade work. Handsome
Holly he was called once. But now that he&#8217;s dead, maybe
we&#8217;ll see he was not the only one to work mischief between
the whites and reds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Holly? Lee Holly?&#8221; asked Lyster. &#8220;Why, didn&#8217;t we
hear a rumor that he wasn&#8217;t dead at all, but had been seen
somewhere near Butte?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; returned Overton, who was the one addressed,
&#8220;though it may be so. He&#8217;s a very slippery specimen
and full of schemes, from what I hear. But he
doesn&#8217;t seem to range over this territory, so I&#8217;ve never run
across him. It would be like him, though, to play dead
when the Government men grew warm on his trail, and
he&#8217;d no doubt get plenty of help from his Indian allies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harris was watching him keenly, and the careless honesty
of the speaker&#8217;s face and tone evidently perplexed
him, for he turned with a baffled look to the girl, who
stood with down-dropped eyes, and twisted a spray of
leaves nervously around her fingers. He noticed one
quick, troubled glance she gave Overton, but even to his
suspicious eyes it did not seem a regard given a fellow-conspirator.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it was the doctor I heard speak of the rumor
that Holly was yet above ground,&#8221; said Lyster. &#8220;The
mail came up yesterday, and perhaps he found it in the
papers. Don&#8217;t think I had heard of the man before. Is
he one of the important people up here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; remarked Overton, &#8220;an accomplished crook
who has dabbled in several trades in the Columbia River
region. The latest was a wholesale horse steal from a
ranch over in Washington&mdash;Indian work, with him as
leader. The regulars from the fort got after them,
there was an ugly fight, and the reds reported Holly as
killed. That is the last I heard of him. You were asking
me yesterday if he ever prospected in our valley,
didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked, turning to Harris.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man made undue importance of by the stupid Indians,&#8221;
declared Captain Leek. &#8220;He humored their superstitions
and played medicine man with them, I&#8217;ve heard;
and he had a boy for a partner&mdash;a young slip the gamblers
called &#8217;Monte&#8217; down in C&oelig;ur d&#8217;Alene.
Some said it was his son.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A fine instructor for youth,&#8221; observed Lyster. &#8220;Who
could expect anything but vice from a man who had such
a boyhood?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you would,&#8221; said &#8217;Tana, suddenly, &#8220;if you knew
that boy when he grew to be a man. If he was bad, you&#8217;d
want him to get off the earth where you walked; and
you never once would stop to ask if he was brought up
right or not&mdash;you know you wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;nobody does, I
guess. I don&#8217;t know why it is, but it seems all wrong to
me. Maybe, though, when I go to school, and learn
things, I will think like the rest, and not care.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyster shrugged his shoulders and looked after her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
as she vanished into the regions where Mrs. Huzzard
was concocting dishes for the mid-day meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I doubt if she thinks like the rest,&#8221; he remarked.
&#8220;How fiery she is, and how independent in her views of
things.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Overton smiled at her curt speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor &#8217;Tana has lived among rough scenes until she
learns to judge quickly, and for herself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Her
words are true enough, too; she may have known just
such boys as Holly&#8217;s clever little partner and seen how
hard it was for them to be any good. I wonder now what
has become of young &#8217;Monte&#8217; since Holly disappeared.
He would be a good one to follow, if there is doubt as
to Holly&#8217;s death being a fact. I believe there was a reward
out for him some time ago, to stimulate lagging
justice. Don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s withdrawn or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Square,&#8221; decided Harris, in silent communion with
himself, as he surveyed Overton; &#8220;dead square, and
don&#8217;t scent the trail. I&#8217;d like to know what their little
game is with him. Some devilment, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>On one pretext and another he kept close to Overton.
He was studying the stalwart, easy-going keeper of the
peace, and Dan, who had a sort of compassion for all
who were halt, or blind, or homeless, took kindly enough
to the semi-paralyzed stranger. Harris seemed to belong
nowhere in particular, yet knew each trail of the
Kootenai and Columbia country, knew each drift where
the yellow sands were found&mdash;each mine where the silver
hunt paid best returns.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve prospected some, I see, even if you don&#8217;t get
over the ground very fast,&#8221; Dan remarked; &#8220;and with it
all, I reckon you&#8217;ve staked out some pay claims for yourself?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>The face of Harris contracted in a swift frown; he
drew a long breath, and his clasped hands tightened on
each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; he said, in a choked, nervous sort of way; &#8220;I
did. If I could tell you of it, I would. You&#8217;re the sort
of man I&#8217;d&mdash;But never mind. I&#8217;m not well yet&mdash;not
strong enough to get excited over it. I&#8217;ve got to take
things easy for a spell, or another stroke of this paralysis
will come as my share. That handicaps me considerable.
I was&mdash;was upset by something unexpected last night,
and I&#8217;ve had a queer, shaky feeling ever since; can&#8217;t articulate
clear. Did you notice? The&mdash;the only thing
under God&#8217;s heaven I&#8217;m afraid of is that paralysis&mdash;that
it will catch me again before I get my work done; and
to-day&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk of it,&#8221; advised Overton, as he noticed how
the man&#8217;s voice hesitated and trembled, how excitable he
was over the subject of his mineral finds and his threatened
helplessness. &#8220;Don&#8217;t think of it, and you&#8217;ll come
out all right yet. If I can do anything for you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man laughed in a spasmodic, contemptuous
fashion.</p>
<p>&#8220;For me?&#8221; he said. &#8220;You can&#8217;t. I thought you could,
but I was on a blind trail&mdash;you can&#8217;t. I can give you a
lift, though&mdash;yes, I can. It&#8217;s about&mdash;about that girl.
You&mdash;you tried to guard her last night, as if she was a
flower the rough wind must not blow on. I know&mdash;I
watched you. I&#8217;ve been there, and know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Know what? You&#8217;re an infernal fool!&#8221; burst out
Dan, with all his good nature out of sight. &#8220;No hints
about the girl, or&mdash;or anything else! I won&#8217;t have it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no hint; facts are all I&#8217;d mention to you, and I&#8217;d
do that just because I think you&#8217;re square. And they&mdash;they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
are playing you. See? For he ain&#8217;t dead. I don&#8217;t
know what their game is with you, but he ain&#8217;t dead; and
there&mdash;there&#8217;s no telling what scheme he&#8217;s got her into
this&mdash;this territory for. So I want you to know. I don&#8217;t
want you to be caught in any trap of theirs. She&mdash;she
looks all right; but he&#8217;s a devil&mdash;a thing infernal&mdash;a&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton caught him by one arm, and swung him around
like a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;Speak clear. No more of your blasted stuttering or
beating away from points; who is the man you talk of?
Who is playing with me? Now speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Monte, the girl; Monte and Lee Holly. He&#8217;s
somewhere alive&mdash;that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m trying to tell you. I
was hunting for him when I found her laying low here,
don&#8217;t you understand? You stare so. It is Lee Holly
and&mdash; Ah&mdash;my&mdash;God!&#8221;</p>
<p>The last words were gurgled in his throat; his face
whitened, and he sank to the ground as though his bones
had suddenly been converted into jelly&mdash;a strange, shapeless
heap of humanity as he lay at Overton&#8217;s feet. Overton
bent over him, and after a moment of blank amaze,
lifted the helpless head, and almost dropped it again,
when the eyes, appealing and keenly conscious, met his
own. There was a queer chuckling sound in the man&#8217;s
throat; he was trying to speak, but could not. The secret
he was trying to tell was buried back of those speechless
lips, and one more stroke of the doom he feared had
overtaken him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<h3>THE STRANGER&#8217;S LOVE STORY.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8217;Tana sat alone in her room a few hours later, and
from the window watched the form of Ora Harrison disappear
along the street. The latter had been sent by
her father with some medicine for the paralyzed stranger,
and the girls had chatted of the school &#8217;Tana was to attend,
and of the schools Ora had gone to and all the
friends she remembered there, who now sent her such
kind letters. Ora told &#8217;Tana of the lovely time she expected
to have when the steamers would come up from
Bonner&#8217;s Ferry to the Kootenai Lake region, for then her
friends were to come in the summers, and the warm
months were to be like holidays.</p>
<p>All this girlish frankness, all the cheery friendship
of the doctor&#8217;s family filled &#8217;Tana with a wild unrest
against herself&mdash;against the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be easy to be good if a person lived like that
always,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;in a nice home, with a mother to
kiss me and a father I was not ashamed of. I felt stupid
when they talked to me. I could only think how happy
they were, and that they did not seem to know it. And
Ora was sweet and sorry for me because my parents were
dead. Huh!&#8221; she grunted, disdainfully, in the Indian
fashion peculiar to her at times. &#8220;If she knew how I felt
about it she&#8217;d hate me, I suppose. They&#8217;d all think I was
bad clear through. They wouldn&#8217;t understand the reason&mdash;no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
nice women like them could. Oh, if the school
would only make me nice like that! But I suppose it&#8217;s
got to be born in people, and I was born different.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even this reason did not render her more resigned;
and, to add to her disquiet, there came to her the memory
of eyes whose gaze made her shiver&mdash;the eyes of the
stranger whom Overton had carried into the house for
dead, but whose brain was yet alive. He had looked at
her with a strange, wild stare, and Overton himself had
turned his eyes toward her in moody questioning when
she came forward to help. He had accepted the help,
but each time she raised her eyes she saw that Dan was
looking at her with a new watchfulness; all his interest
in the stricken stranger did not keep him from that.</p>
<p>&#8220;If any one is accountable for this, I guess I&#8217;m the
man,&#8221; he confessed, ruefully. &#8220;He told me he was afraid
of this, yet I was fool enough to lose my temper and
turn him around rough. It might have struck him, anyway;
but my conscience doesn&#8217;t let me down easy. He&#8217;ll
be my care till some one comes along with a stronger
claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe there is some one somewhere,&#8221; said &#8217;Tana.
&#8220;There might be letters, if it would be right to look.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there are relatives anywhere in the settlements,
I guess they&#8217;d be glad enough if I&#8217;d look,&#8221; decided Overton.
&#8220;There is no way to get permission from him,
though,&#8221; and he looked in the helpless man&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;d say to this if you could speak,
stranger,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but to go through your pockets seems
the only way to locate you or your friends; so I&#8217;ll have to
do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not easy to do, with those eyes staring at him
in that horrible way. But he tried to avoid the eyes, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
thrust his hand into the inner pocket, drawing out an
ordinary notebook, some scraps of newspaper folded up
in it, and two letters addressed to Joe Hammond; one to
Little Dalles, and the other had evidently been delivered
by a messenger, for no destination was marked on it. It
was an old letter and the envelope was worn through all
around the edges. Another paper was wrapped around
it, and the writing was of a light feminine character.
Overton touched it with a certain reverence and looked
embarrassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think, Mrs. Huzzard, I will ask you to read this,
as it seems a lady&#8217;s letter, and if there is any information
in it, you can give it to us; if not, I&#8217;ll just put it back in
his pocket and hope luck will tell us what the letter
doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Huzzard demurred: &#8220;And me that short-sighted
that even specs won&#8217;t cure it! No, indeed. I&#8217;m
no one to read important papers. But here&#8217;s &#8217;Tana, with
eyes like a hawk for sighting things. She&#8217;ll read it fast
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton looked undecided, remembering those strange
insinuations of the now helpless man, and feeling that
the man himself might not be willing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;well&mdash;I guess not,&#8221; he said, at last. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t just
square to send a little girl blindfold like that into a
stranger&#8217;s claim. We&#8217;ll let some one over twenty-one
read the letters. You&#8217;ll do, Max, and if it ain&#8217;t all right,
you can stop up short.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Lyster read the treasured message, all in the same
feminine writing. His sensitive face grew grave, and
he turned compassionate glances toward the helpless man
as he read the letters, according to their dates. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
oldest one was the only one not sad. Its postmark was a
little town many miles to the south.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dear Old Joe</span>: It&#8217;s awful to be this near you, and
know you are sick, without being able to get to you. I
just arrived, and your partner has met me, and told me
all about it. But I&#8217;ll go up with him, just the same; and
when you are able to travel we can come down to a town
and be married, instead of to-day, as we had set on. So
that&#8217;s all right, and don&#8217;t you worry. Your partner,
John Ingalls, is as nice as he can be to me. Why did
you not tell me how good looking he was? Maybe you
never discovered it&mdash;you slow, prosy old Joe! When
you wrote to me of that rich find you stumbled on, I was
sorry you had picked up a partner; for you always did
trust folks too much, and I was afraid you&#8217;d be cheated
by the stranger you picked up. But I guess that I was
wrong, Joe; for he is a very nice gentleman&mdash;the nicest
I ever met, I think. And he talks about you just as if
he was your brother, and thought a heap of you. He
tried to tease me some, too&mdash;asked how you ever came to
catch such a pretty girl as me! Then I told him, Joe,
that you never had to catch me&mdash;that I was little, and
hadn&#8217;t any folks, and how you got your folks to give me a
home when you was only a boy; and that you was always
like a big brother to me till you made some money
in the mines. Then you wrote and asked me to come out
and marry you. He just laughed, Joe, and said it was not
a brother&#8217;s love that a wife wanted; but I don&#8217;t think he
knows anything about that&mdash;do you? And, Joe, I came
pretty near telling him all about that richest find you
made&mdash;the one you said you wanted me to be the first to
see. I thought, of course, you had told your partner,
just as you told me when you sent me the plan of it&mdash;what
for, I don&#8217;t know, Joe, for I never could find it in
the wide world, even if there was any chance of my hunting
for it alone. Your partner asked me point blank if
you had written to me of any late find of yours, or of any
special location where you found good signs. I tried to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
look innocent, and said maybe you had, but I couldn&#8217;t remember.
I didn&#8217;t like to tell a story. I wanted to tell
him all the truth, and how rich you said we would be.
I knew you would want to tell him yourself, so I managed
to keep quiet in time. But whenever he looks at me I feel
guilty. And he looks at me so kindly, and he is so good.
He says we can&#8217;t begin our journey to you right away,
because he has provisions and things to get first; but we
will set out in three days. So I send this letter that you
will know I am on the road; maybe we&#8217;ll reach you first.
He is going to take me riding around this camp this
evening&mdash;I mean Mr. Ingalls. He says I must get some
enjoyment before I go up there to the mountains, where
no one lives. He is the nicest stranger I ever met. But,
of course, I never was away from home much to meet
folks; I guess, though, I might travel a long ways and not
meet any one so nice. He just brought me a pretty purse
made by the Indians. I hope you wear a big hat like he
does, and big, high boots. I never saw folks wear them
back home; but they do look nice. Now, good-by, Joe,
for a few days.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p style='margin-right:4em;'>&#8220;Yours affectionately,</p>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Fannie</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>&#8220;Well, that letter is plain sailing,&#8221; remarked Overton,
&#8220;but there is only one name in it we could follow up&mdash;the
partner, John Ingalls. But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve heard of
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait! there is another letter&mdash;two more,&#8221; said Lyster;
and the others were silent as he read:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Joe</span>: I hope you&#8217;ll hate me now. I can stand that
better than to know you still like me. I can&#8217;t help it. I
am going with him&mdash;your partner. He loves me, too,
Joe&mdash;not in the brotherly way you did, but in a way that
makes me think of him and no one else. So I can&#8217;t marry
any one but him. Maybe it&#8217;s a sin to be false to you, Joe;
but I never could go to you now. And I can&#8217;t help going
where he wants me to go. Don&#8217;t be mad at him;
he can&#8217;t help it either, I suppose. He says he will always
be good to me, and I am going. But my heart is heavy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
as I write to you. I am not happy&mdash;maybe because I love
him too much. But I am going. Try and forget me.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Fannie</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>In dead silence Lyster unfolded the third paper. The
drama of this stranger&#8217;s life was a pathetic thing to the
listeners, who looked at him with pity in their eyes, but
could utter no words of sympathy to the man who sat
there helpless and looked at them. Then the last, a penciled
sheet, was read.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Joe</span>: I am dying, I think. The Indian woman with
me says so; and I hope it is true. He came to me to-day&mdash;the
first time in weeks. He never married me, as he
promised. He cursed me to-day because my baby face
led him away from a fortune he knows you found. I
never told him, though it is a wonder. All he knows of
it he heard you say in your sleep when you were sick that
time. To-day he told me you were paralyzed, Joe&mdash;that
you are helpless still&mdash;that he has taken Indians with
him there to your old claim, and searched every foot of
ground for the gold vein he thinks you know of. But it
is of no use, and he is furious over it, and so taunts me
of your helplessness alone in the wilderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe, I still have the plan you made of the river and
the two little streams and the marked tree. Can&#8217;t I
make amends some way for the wrong I did you? Is
there anywhere a friend you could trust to work the find
and take care of you? For if you are too helpless to
write yourself, and can get only the name of the person
to me, I will send the plan some way to him. I know I
am not to live long. I am in a perfect fever to hear from
you, and tell you that my sin against you weighs me down
to despair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t tell you of my life with him; it is too horrible.
I do not even know who he is, for Ingalls is not his name.
We are with Indians and they call him &#8217;Medicine,&#8217; and
seem to know him well. He has left me here, to-day,
and I feel I will never see him again. He tells me he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
has sent for a young white boy who is to be brought to
camp, and who will help care for me. Anything would
be better than the sly red faces about me; they fill me
with terror. My one hope is that the boy may get this
letter sent to you, and that some word may come to me
from you before my life ends. It has taken me all this
day to write to you.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by. I am dying miserably, and I deserve it. I
can&#8217;t even tell you where to write me; only we are with
Indians camped by a big river. Not far away is a wall
of rock, like a hill, beside the river, and Indian writing
is cut on the wall, and holes and things are cut all along
it.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;The Arrow lakes of the Columbia!&#8221; interrupted Overton&mdash;</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;If the boy comes, and is to be trusted at all, he may
tell me more; that is my only hope of this reaching you.
If you are not able to make another plan (and he says
your hands are powerless) remember, I have the one
you did make. If you can send me one word&mdash;one name
of a friend&mdash;I will try&mdash;try so hard. He would kill me
if he knew, and I would be glad of it, if I could only help
you first. I feel that I will never see you again.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Fannie</span>.&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard was crying and whispering, &#8220;Poor dear!&mdash;poor
child!&#8221; and even the voice of Lyster was not
quite steady as he read. Those straggling, weak pencil
marks had a pathos of their own to him. The letter,
crossed and recrossed by the lines, was on two pages,
evidently torn from the back of a book.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems a sacrilege to dive into a man&#8217;s feelings and
secrets like this,&#8221; he said, ruefully. &#8220;It <i>is</i>! My only consolation
is that I did it with good intent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And, after all, not a plain trail found that will help
us locate this man or his friends,&#8221; decided Overton&mdash;&#8220;not
a name we can really fasten to but the name on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
envelope&mdash;Joe Hammond. It is too bad. Why, &#8217;Tana!
Good God! <i>&#8217;Tana!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>For the girl, who had uttered no word, but had listened
to that last letter with whitened face and staring eyes,
leaned against the wall at its close, and a little gasp
from her drew their attention.</p>
<p>She fell forward on her face ere Overton could reach
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tana, my girl, what is it? Speak!&#8221; he entreated.</p>
<p>But the girl only whispered: &#8220;I know now! Joe&mdash;Joe
Hammond!&#8221; and fainted dead away at the feet of the
paralyzed man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<h3>&#8217;TANA AND JOE.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Just like a part in a play, captain&mdash;that&#8217;s just the way
it struck me,&#8221; said Mrs. Huzzard, recounting the affair
for the benefit of the postmaster of Sinna Ferry. &#8220;The
man a-sitting there like a statue, with only his eyes looking
alive, and that poor, scared dear a-falling down on
the floor beside him, and looking as white as milk! I
never had a notion she was so easy touched by people&#8217;s
troubles. It surely was a sorry story read from them
three letters. I tell you, sir, men leave women with
aching hearts many&#8217;s the time,&#8221; and she glanced sentimentally
toward her listener; &#8220;though if there is one
place more heart-rending to be deserted in than another, I
think an Indian village would be the very worst. Just
to think of that poor dear dying there in a place she didn&#8217;t
even know the name of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! I&#8217;ve an idea you are giving your sympathy
to the wrong individual,&#8221; decided the captain. &#8220;It must
be easier even to die in some unknown corner than for
a living soul to be shut up in a dead body, after the manner
of this Harris, or Hammond, or whatever his name
is. I guess, from the looks of things, he must have collapsed
when that second letter reached him; had a bad
stroke, and was just recovering somewhat when he
strayed into this camp. Yes, madame, I&#8217;ve an idea he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
had a harder row to hoe than the girl; and, then, it
doesn&#8217;t look as though he&#8217;d deserved it so much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dan is mightily upset over it, ain&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Dan is just as likely to get upset over any other
vagabond who strays in his direction,&#8221; grumbled the
captain. &#8220;Folks are always falling in his way to be
looked after. He has the worst luck! He never did a
bit of harm to this stranger&mdash;nothing but drop a hand
on his shoulder; and all at once the man falls down
helpless. And Dan feels in duty bound to take care of
him. Then the girl &#8217;Tana has to flop over in the same
way, just when I thought we were to get rid of her.
And she&#8217;s another charge to look after. He&#8217;ll be wanting
to hire your house for a hospital next thing, Mrs.
Huzzard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And welcome he&#8217;d be to it for &#8217;Tana,&#8221; declared Mrs.
Huzzard, valiantly. &#8220;She&#8217;s been a bit saucy to you at
times, and I know it; but, indeed, it&#8217;s only because she
fancies you don&#8217;t like her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like her, madame! A girl who plays poker, and&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And wins,&#8221; added Mrs. Huzzard, with a twinkle in
her eyes. &#8220;Ah, now, didn&#8217;t Mr. Max tell me the whole
story! She is a clip, and I know it; but I think she
only meant that game as a bit of a joke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A twenty-dollar joke, Mrs. Huzzard, is too expensive
to be funny,&#8221; growled the captain, with natural discontent.
&#8220;But if I could only convince myself that the money
was honestly won, I would not feel so annoyed over it;
but I can&#8217;t&mdash;no, madame. I am confident there was a
trick in that game&mdash;some gambler&#8217;s trick she has picked
up among her promiscuous acquaintances. And I am
annoyed&mdash;more than ever annoyed now that there is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
chance of her remaining longer under Dan&#8217;s care. She&#8217;s
a dangerous <i>protégée</i> for a boy of his age, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dangerous! Oh, now, I&#8217;ve my doubts of that,&#8221; said
Mrs. Huzzard, shaking her head, emphatically. &#8220;You
take my word for it, if she&#8217;s dangerous as a girl to any
one in this camp, it&#8217;s not Mr. Dan&#8217;s peace of mind she&#8217;s
disturbing, but that of his new friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean Lyster? Ridiculous! A gentleman of
culture, used to the best society, give a thought to such
an unclassed individual? No, madame!&mdash;don&#8217;t you believe
it. His interest about the school affair was doubtless
to get her away from camp, and to keep her from being
a responsibility on Dan&#8217;s hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum! maybe. But, from all the dances he danced
with her, and the way he waited on her, I&#8217;d a notion
that he did not think her a great responsibility at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>This conversation occurred the morning after those
letters had been read. The owner of them was installed
in the best room Mrs. Huzzard had to offer, and miners
from all sections were cordially invited to visit the paralyzed
man, in the vain hope that some one would chance
to remember his face, or help establish the lost miner&#8217;s
identity; for he seemed utterly lost from all record of his
past&mdash;all but that he had loved a girl whom an unknown
partner had stolen. And Overton remembered that he
seemed especially interested in the whereabouts of the
renegade, Lee Holly.</p>
<p>The unknown Lee Holly&#8217;s name had suddenly attained
the importance of a gruesome ghost to Overton. He had
stared gloomily at the paralytic, as though striving to
glean from the living eyes the secrets held close by the
silenced lips. &#8217;Tana and Monte and Lee Holly!&mdash;his
little girl and those renegades! Surely these persons
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
could have nothing to do with each other. Harris was
looney&mdash;so Overton decided as he stalked back and forth
beside the house, glancing up once in a while to a window
above him&mdash;a window where he hoped to see &#8217;Tana&#8217;s
face; for all one day had gone, and the evening come
again, yet he had never seen her since he had lifted her
unconscious form from beside the chair of Harris. Her
words, &#8220;I know now! Joe&mdash;Joe Hammond!&#8221; were yet
whispering through his senses. Did those words mean
anything? or was the child simply overwrought by that
tragedy told in the letters? He did not imagine she would
comprehend all the sadness of it until she had fallen in
that faint.</p>
<p>The night he had talked with her first in Akkomi&#8217;s
tepee, and afterward in the morning by the river, he had
promised to be satisfied with what she chose to tell him
of herself, and ask no questions of her past. But since
the insinuations of Harris and her own peculiar words
and manner, he discovered that the promise was not
easy to keep&mdash;especially when Lyster besieged him with
questions; for &#8217;Tana had spent the day utterly alone, but
for the ministrations of Mrs. Huzzard. She would not
see even the doctor, as she said she was not sick. She
would not see Overton, Lyster, or any one else, because
she said she did not want to talk; she was tired, and
that reason must suffice. It did for Lyster, especially
after he had received a nod, a smile, and a wave of her
hand from her window&mdash;a circumstance he related hopefully
to Overton, as it banished the lingering fear in his
mind that her exile was one caused by absolute illness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I candidly believe, Dan, that she is simply ashamed
of having fainted before us last evening&mdash;fancies it looks
weak, I suppose; and she does pride herself so on her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
ungirlish strength. I&#8217;ve no doubt she will emerge from
her seclusion to-morrow morning, and expect us to ignore
her sentimental swoon. How is your other patient?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, just the difference of turning his eyes quickly
toward a thing, instead of slowly, as at first. The doctor
just told me he is able to move his head slightly, so I
guess he is not to go under this trip. But he&#8217;ll never
be a well man again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather heavy on you, old fellow, that you feel bound
to look after him. I can&#8217;t see the necessity of it. Why
don&#8217;t you let the rest of the camp&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But Overton had turned away and resumed his walk.
Lyster stared at him in wonder for a moment and then
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Rothschild,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;You know the
depth of your own purse best. But, to tell the truth, you
don&#8217;t act like your own responsible self to-day. You go
moping around as though the other fellow&#8217;s stroke had
touched you, too. You are a great fellow, Dan, to take
other people&#8217;s loads on your shoulders; but it is a bad
habit, and you&#8217;d better reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, when I have time,&#8221; returned Overton, with a
grim smile. &#8220;Just now I have other things to think of.
Don&#8217;t mind me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t. I confess I don&#8217;t mind any of you very
much since I saw the cheery vision of your <i>protégée</i> at
the window&mdash;and waving her hand to me, too; the first
bit of sunshine I&#8217;ve seen in camp to-day. For the average
specimen I&#8217;ve run across has looked to me like you&mdash;glum.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>Receiving no reply whatever to this criticism, he strolled
away after a smiling glance upward to &#8217;Tana&#8217;s window.
But no girlish hand waved greeting to him this time, and
he comforted himself by humming, &#8220;My Love is but a
Lassie Yet.&#8221; This was a mischievous endeavor to attract
Overton&#8217;s attention and make him say something, even
though the something should prove uncomplimentary to
the warbler.</p>
<p>But it was a failure. Overton only thrust his hands
a little deeper in his pockets as he stared after the handsome,
light-hearted fellow. Of course, it would be Max
to whom she would wave her hand; and he was glad
somebody felt like singing, though he himself could not.
His mind was too much tormented by the thoughts of
those two who formed a nucleus for the hospital already
contemptuously alluded to by the captain.</p>
<p>And those two?</p>
<p>One sat almost motionless, as he had been for the
twenty-four hours. But as Mrs. Huzzard and the captain
left his room, each spoke hopefully of his appearance.
Mrs. Huzzard especially was very confident his
face showed more animation than she had observed at
her noonday visit; and the fact that he could move his
head and nod in reply to questions certainly did seem
to promise recovery.</p>
<p>In the adjoining room, close to the very thin partition,
&#8217;Tana lay with ears strained to catch each word of the
conversation. But when her door was opened by Mrs.
Huzzard, all semblance of interest was gone, and she lay
on the little bed with closed eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m right glad she&#8217;s taking a nap at last,&#8221; said the good
soul as she closed the door softly. &#8220;That child scarce
slept a bit all night, and I know it. Curious how nervous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
she got over that man&#8217;s troubles. But, of course, he did
look awful at first, and nigh about scared me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Tana lay still till the steps died away on the stairs,
and the voices were heard more faintly on the lower
floor. All the day she had waited for the people to leave
the stranger in the next room alone; and, for the first
time, no voice of visitors broke the silence of the upper
floor.</p>
<p>She slipped to the door and listened. Her movements
were stealthy as that of some forest animal evading a
hunter. She turned the knob softly, and with still swiftness
was inside the stranger&#8217;s room, and the door closed
behind her.</p>
<p>He certainly was more alert, for his eyes met hers
instantly. His look was almost one of fear, and she was
trembling visibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had to come,&#8221; she said, nervously, in a half whisper,
&#8220;I heard the letters read, and I have to tell you something
I&#8217;ve thought all night&mdash;all day&mdash;and I have to tell
you. Do you understand? Try to understand. Nod
your head if you do. Do you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her speech was rapid and impatient, while she
listened each moment lest a step sound on the stairs again.
But in all her eagerness to hear she never looked away
from his face, and she uttered a low exclamation of gladness
when the man&#8217;s head bent slowly in assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so glad&mdash;so glad! You will get well; you
must! Listen! I know you now, and why you looked
at me so. You think you saw me up at Revelstoke&mdash;I
think I remember your face there&mdash;and you don&#8217;t trust
me. You are looking for that man&mdash;the man that took
her away from you. You think I could find a trail to
him; but you are wrong. He is dead, and I know she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
is&mdash;I <i>know</i>! Your name was the last word she said&mdash;&#8216;Joe.&#8217;
She wanted you to forgive her, and not cross
<i>his</i> path. You don&#8217;t believe me, perhaps; but it is all
true. I went to the camp with&mdash;with the boy she wrote
of. She talked of you to me. I had word to give you
if we ever met. But how was I to know that Jim Harris
was the man&mdash;the same man? Do you hear&mdash;do you
believe me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Those burning eyes&mdash;eyes in which all of life in him
seemed concentrated&mdash;looked out on her from the pale,
strange face; looked on her until her own cheeks grew
colorless, for there was something awful in the searching
regard of the man who was but half alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; she said, and slipped from her belt a package
in which paper rustled, &#8220;I&#8217;ve had that plan of the gold
find ever since&mdash;since she died. She gave it to me, in
case you should be&mdash;as you are, and no one to look
after it for you. Or, if you should go under, she said, I
was to look it up. And I started to look it up&mdash;yes, I did;
but things were against me, and I let it go for a while.
But now, listen! If you get well, it means money must do
it. See? Dan hasn&#8217;t very much&mdash;not enough to float you
long. Now, I&#8217;ve thought it all out. You give up the notion
of looking for that man, who wasn&#8217;t worth a shot of
powder when he was alive, and worth less now. It&#8217;s that
notion that&#8217;s been eating the life out of you. Oh, I&#8217;ve
thought it all out! Now you just turn honest prospector,
like you was when that man Ingalls first spotted
you. I&#8217;m only a girl, but I&#8217;ll try to help make amends
for the wrongs he did you. I&#8217;ll go partners with you.
Look! here is the plan; and I&#8217;m almost sure I know
where the two little streams meet. I&#8217;ve thought of it
a heap; but the face of&mdash;of that dead girl, kept me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
from doing anything till I had either found you or knew
you were dead. No one knows I have the plan&mdash;though
<i>he</i> would have cut throats for it. Now do you trust
me?&#8221;</p>
<p>She held the plan up so he could see it&mdash;a queer
puzzle of lines and dots; but a glance sufficed, and he
turned his eyes again to the face of the girl. Her
eagerness, her intensity, awakened him to trust and
sympathy. He looked at her and nodded his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I knew you would!&#8221; she breathed, thankfully.
&#8220;And I&#8217;ll stand by you&mdash;you&#8217;ll see! I&#8217;ve wanted a
chance like this&mdash;a chance to make up for some of the
devilment he&#8217;s done to folks&mdash;and some he&#8217;s made me
help at. You know who I am, but none of the rest do&mdash;and
they sha&#8217;n&#8217;t. I&#8217;m a new girl now. I want to
make up for some of the badness that has been. It&#8217;s
all over; but sometimes I hate the blood in my veins
because&mdash;you know! And if I can only do <i>some</i>
good&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She paused, for the eyes of the paralyzed man had
moved from her face, and were resting on something
back of her.</p>
<p>It was Overton! He entered and closed the door, and
stood looking doubtful and astonished, while &#8217;Tana rose
to her feet trembling and a little pale.</p>
<p>&#8220;How long&mdash;were you there?&#8221; she demanded, angrily.</p>
<p>He looked at her very steadily before making reply&mdash;such
a curious, searching look that she moved uneasily
because of it; but her face remained defiant.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just now opened the door,&#8221; he said at last, speaking
in a slow, deliberate way. &#8220;I slipped here as quietly
as I could, because they told me you were asleep, and I
must not make a noise. I got here just as you were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
telling this man that no one but him should know who
you were before you came among us&mdash;that is all, I
guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had sat down on a seat close to Harris, and
dropped her face in her hands.</p>
<p>Overton stood with his back against the door, looking
down at her. In his eyes was a keen sorrow as she
sat down in that despairing fashion, and crept close to
the stranger as though for refuge from <i>him</i>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might have avoided telling what I heard,&#8221; he continued;
&#8220;but I don&#8217;t think that would be quite square
among friends. Then, as I see you have found a new
acquaintance here, I thought maybe you would have
something to tell me if you knew what I heard you say
to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, kindly as his words were, she seemed to shrink
from them.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; I can&#8217;t. Oh, Mr. Dan, I can&#8217;t&mdash;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; she
muttered, with her head still bowed on the arm of the
chair occupied by Harris. &#8220;If you can&#8217;t trust me any
more, I can&#8217;t blame you. But I can&#8217;t tell you&mdash;that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll just go down stairs again,&#8221; he decided,
&#8220;and you can finish your talk with Harris. I&#8217;ll keep
the rest of the folks from interrupting you as I did. But
if you want me, little girl, you know I&#8217;ll not be far
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tears came in her eyes. His persistent kindness
to her made her both ashamed and glad, and she reached
out her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; she said, &#8220;maybe I have something to tell
you,&#8221; and she unfolded the paper again and showed it
to Harris.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I tell him? Would you rather he would be
the man to do the business?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;You know
I&#8217;m willing, but I don&#8217;t know enough myself. Do you
want him to be the man?&#8221;</p>
<p>Harris nodded his head.</p>
<p>With a look of relief on her face, she turned to Overton,
who watched them wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What sort of man is it you want? or what is it you
want to tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only that I&#8217;ve found a plan of the ground where
he made that rich find the letter told of,&#8221; she answered,
with a bit of a tremble in her voice. &#8220;He&#8217;s never been
able to look after it himself, and was afraid to trust
any one. But now&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have the plan&mdash;<i>you</i>, &#8217;Tana?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I have it. I think I even know where the place
is located. But&mdash;don&#8217;t ask me anything about how I
got the plan. He knows, and is satisfied&mdash;that is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, &#8217;Tana, I don&#8217;t understand. You are giving me
surprises too thick this evening. If he has found a rich
yield of ore, and has taken you into partnership, it
means that you will be a rich woman. A streak of pay
ore can do more for you than a ranger like myself; so
I guess you can afford to drop me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face fell forward in her hands again. The man
in the chair looked at her and then turned his eyes pleadingly
to the other man, who remained standing close
to the door.</p>
<p>Overton recognized the pleading quality of the glance,
and was filled with amazement by it. Witchery seemed
to have touched the stranger when paralysis touched
him, else he would not so quickly have changed from
his suspicion of the girl into that mute pleading for her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>She was trying so hard to keep back the tears, and in
the effort her jaws were set and her brows drawn together
stormily. She looked to him as she had looked
in the lodge of Akkomi.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t trust me,&#8221; she said at last; &#8220;that&#8217;s why
you won&#8217;t help us. But you ought to, for I&#8217;ve never lied
to you. If it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m in it that you won&#8217;t have
anything to do with the mine, I&#8217;ll leave. I won&#8217;t bother
you about that school. I won&#8217;t bother you about anything.
I&#8217;ll help locate the place if&mdash;if Joe here is willing;
and then you two can be partners, and I&#8217;ll be out
of it, for I can trust you to take care of him, and see
that the money does what it can for him. I can trust
you if you can&#8217;t me. So you are the one to speak up.
What is your answer?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<h3>PARTNERS.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve been a &#8217;hoodoo&#8217; all my, life; and if I only
lead some one into luck now&mdash;good luck&mdash;oh, wouldn&#8217;t
I learn a sun-dance, and dance it!&#8221;</p>
<p>The world was two weeks older, and it was &#8217;Tana
who spoke; not the troubled &#8217;Tana who had crouched
beside the paralytic and cowered under her fear of Overton&#8217;s
distrust, but a girl grown lighter-hearted by the
help of work to be done&mdash;work in which she was for
once to stand side by side with Overton himself, for his
decision about the prospecting had been in her favor.
He had &#8220;spoken up,&#8221; as she had asked him to do, and
a curious three-cornered partnership had been arranged
the next day; a very mysterious partnership, of which
no word was told to any one. Only &#8217;Tana suddenly decided
that the schooling must wait a little longer. Lyster
would have to make the trip to Helena without her;
she was not feeling like it just then, and so forth.</p>
<p>Therefore, despite the very earnest arguments of Mr.
Lyster, he did have to go alone. During all the journey,
he was conscious of a quite unreasonable disappointment,
an impatience with even Overton, for not enforcing
his authority as guardian, and insisting that she at
once commence the many studies in which she was sadly
deficient.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span></p>
<p>But Overton had stood back and said nothing. Lyster
did not understand it, and could not succeed in making
either of them communicative.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be back here in less than a month,&#8221; said Overton.
&#8220;We will send her then, if she feels equal to it. In
the meantime, we&#8217;ll take the best care we can of her
here at the Ferry. I find I will have time to look after
her a little until then. I have only one short trip to make
up the river; so don&#8217;t get uneasy about her. She&#8217;ll be
ready to go next run you make, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Lyster wondered, dissatisfied, and went away. He
was even a little more dissatisfied with his last memory
of the girl&mdash;a vision of her bending over that unknown,
helpless miner. His sympathies were with the man. He
was most willing to assist, in a financial way, toward
taking care of one so unfortunate. But the thing he was
not willing to do was to see &#8217;Tana devote herself without
restraint to the welfare of a stranger&mdash;a man they
knew nothing of&mdash;a fellow who, of course, could have
no appreciation of the great luck he was in to have her
constantly beside him. It was a clean waste of exceptionable
sympathy; and a squaw, or some miner out of work,
would do as well in this case.</p>
<p>He even offered to pay for a squaw, or for any masculine
nurse; but the girl had very promptly suggested
that he busy himself with his own duties, if he had any.
She stated further that he had no control whatever over
her actions, and she could not understand&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I have none,&#8221; he retorted, with some impatience,
and yet a good deal of fondness in his handsome
eyes. &#8220;That is why I&#8217;m complaining. I wish I had.
And if I had, wouldn&#8217;t I whisk you away from this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
uncouth life! I wonder if you will ever let me do so,
Tana?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;d better be packing your plunder,&#8221; she
remarked, coolly. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll keep the whole
outfit waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that was how they let even Lyster go away. Not
a hint was he given of the all-engrossing plan that
bound both &#8217;Tana and Overton to the interests of the
passive stranger, who looked at them with intelligence,
but who could not speak.</p>
<p>Their partnership was a curious affair, and the arrangement
for interests in it was conducted on the one
side by nods or shakes of the head, while the other
two offered suggestions, and asked questions, until a
very clear understanding was arrived at.</p>
<p>Only one knotty discussion had arisen. Overton offered
to give one month of time to the search, on condition
that one half of the find, if there was any made,
should belong to &#8217;Tana, while the original finder should
have the other half. He himself would give that much
time to helping them out in a friendly way; but more
than that he could not give, because of other duties.</p>
<p>To this the man Harris shook his head with all possible
vigor, while &#8217;Tana was quite as emphatic in an
audible way. Harris desired that all shares be equal,
and Overton count himself in for a third. &#8217;Tana approved
the plan, insisting that she would not accept an
ounce of the dust if he did not. So Dan finally agreed
and ended the discussion concerning the division of the
gold they might never find.</p>
<p>&#8220;And don&#8217;t be so dead sure that the dirt will pan
out well, even if we do find the place,&#8221; he said, warningly,
to &#8217;Tana. &#8220;Why, my girl, if the average of dust
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
had been as high as my average of hope over strikes
I&#8217;ve made myself, I would have been a billionaire long
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard you talk of prospecting,&#8221; remarked
&#8217;Tana. &#8220;All the rest do here, and not you&mdash;how is
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, prospecting strikes one like a fever; sometimes
a man recovers from it, or seems to for a while. I had
the fever bad about two years ago&mdash;out in Nevada.
Well, I left there. I sunk my stock of capital in a very
big hole, and lost my enthusiasm for a while. Maybe
I will find it again, drifting along the Kootenai; but as
yet it has not struck me hard. From what I can gather,
this fellow must simply have dropped on a nugget or
little pocket, and something must have made him distrust
his partner to such an extent that he kept the secret
find to himself. So there evidently has been no testing
of the soil, no move toward development. We may
never find an ounce of metal, for such disappointments
have been even where very large nuggets have been
found. You must not expect too much of this search.
Golden hope lets you down hard when you do fall with
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But, despite his warnings, he made arrangements for
their river journey with all speed possible. The three
of them were to go; and, as chaperon, Mrs. Huzzard
was persuaded to join their queer &#8220;picnic&#8221; party, for
that was the idea given abroad concerning their little
trip to the north. It was to be a venture in the interests
of Harris&mdash;supposedly the physical interests; though
Captain Leek did remark, with decided emphasis, that
it was the first time he ever knew of a man being sent
out to live in the woods as a cure for paralysis.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>But the preparations were made; even the fact that
Mrs. Huzzard was seized with an unreasonable attack
of rheumatism on the eve of departure did not deter
them at all.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless you need me to stay here and look after you,
we&#8217;ll go just the same,&#8221; decided &#8217;Tana. &#8220;A squaw
won&#8217;t be much of a substitute for you; but she&#8217;ll be better
than no one, and we&#8217;ll go.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the squaw was secured, through the agency of her
husband, whom Overton knew, and who was to take
their camp outfit up the river for them. This was one
reason why Mrs. Huzzard, as she watched them depart,
was a little thankful for the visitation of rheumatism.</p>
<p>Their camp was only a day old when &#8217;Tana announced
her willingness to dance if only good fortune would
come to her.</p>
<p>It seemed a thing probable, for as Overton poured
water slowly from a tin pan into the shallow little
stream, there were left in the bottom of the pan, as the
last sifting bit of soil was washed out, some tiny bits
of yellow the size of a pin-head, and one as large as a
grain of wheat.</p>
<p>&#8217;Tana gave a little ecstatic cry as she bent over it and
touched the particles with her finger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dan&mdash;it is the gold!&mdash;the real gold! and we are
millionaires!&mdash;millionaires, and you would not believe
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>He raised his finger warningly, and shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until we are millionaires before you commence
to shout,&#8221; he advised. &#8220;It is a good show here&mdash;yes;
but, after all, it may be only a chance washing from
hills far enough away. Show them to Harris, though;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
he may be interested, though he appears to me very indifferent
about the matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He don&#8217;t seem to care,&#8221; she agreed. &#8220;He just looks
at us as though we were a couple of children he had
found a new plaything for. But don&#8217;t you think he
looks brighter?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes; the river trip has done him good, instead
of the harm the Ferry folks prophesied. But you run
along and show him the &#8217;yellow,&#8217; and don&#8217;t draw the
squaw&#8217;s attention to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The squaw was wrapped neck and heels in a blanket,
although the day was one of the warmest of summer;
and stretched asleep in the sun, she gave no heed to the
quick, light step of the girl.</p>
<p>Neither did Harris, at whose tent door she lay. He
must have thought it was the stoical, indifferent Indian,
for he gave her a quick, startled glance as he heard her
surprised &#8220;Oh!&#8221; at the door. Then she walked directly
to him, lifted his right hand, and let go again. It fell
on his knee in the old, helpless way.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you did raise it,&#8221; she said, accusingly. &#8220;I saw
you as I came to the door. You stretched out your
hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at her and nodded very slightly, then looked
at his hand and appeared trying to lift it; but gave up,
and shook his head sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you moved it a little once, but can&#8217;t do
it again?&#8221; she asked, and he nodded assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; she continued, cheerfully.
&#8220;You are sure to get along all right, now that you have
commenced to manage your hands if ever so little. But
just at first, when I saw you, I had a mighty queer notion
come into my head. I thought you were getting over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
that stroke faster than you let us know. But I&#8217;m too
suspicious, ain&#8217;t I? Maybe it&#8217;s a bad thing for folks to
trust strangers too much in this world; but it is just
as bad for a girl to grow up where she can&#8217;t trust any
one. Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man nodded. They had many conversations like
that, and she had grown not to notice his lack of speech
nearly so much as at first. He was so good a listener,
and she had become so used to his face gradually gaining
again expressive power, that she divined his wishes
more readily than the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;But trusting don&#8217;t cut any figure in what I came to
speak to you about,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;No &#8216;trust and
hope on, brethren,&#8217; about this, I guess,&#8221; and she held
the grains of yellow metal before his eyes. &#8220;There it is&mdash;the
gold! Dan found it in the little hollow where the
spring is. Is that where you found it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head, but looked pleased at the show
they had found.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it bigger bundles of it than this you struck?&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bigger than this! Well, it must have been rich.
These lumps are enough in size if they only turn out
enough in number. Oh, how I wish you had put the
very spot on that plan of the ground and the rivers!
Still, I suppose you were right to be cautious. And if
I hadn&#8217;t been on a lone trail through this country last
spring, and got lost, and happened to notice the two
little streams running into the river so close to each
other, we might have had a year&#8217;s journey along the
Kootenai before we could have found the particular little
stream and followed the right one to its source. I think
we are close on the trail now, Joe.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>He shook his head energetically when she called him
Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I forget,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You see, I&#8217;ve been thinking
for months about finding Joe Hammond; and now
that I&#8217;ve found you, I can&#8217;t get used to thinking you are
Jim Harris. What&#8217;s the use of your changing your
name, anyway? You did it so you could trail him, your
partner, better. But what was the use, with him well
and strong, and with devils back of him, and you alone
and barely able to crawl? Your head was wrong, Joe&mdash;Jim,
I mean. If you hadn&#8217;t been looney, you&#8217;d just have
settled down and worked your claim, got rich, and then
looked for your man.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head impatiently, and looked at her with
as much of a frown as his locked muscles would allow,
and a very queer, hard smile about his eyes and mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; and &#8217;Tana shivered a little; &#8220;don&#8217;t look like
that, Joe. You wouldn&#8217;t get any Sunday-school prizes
for a meek and lowly spirit if the manager saw you
fix your face in that fashion. I guess I know how you
felt. If you had just so much strength, and couldn&#8217;t
hope for more, you wouldn&#8217;t waste it looking for gold
while he was above ground. Now, ain&#8217;t I about right?&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave no assent, but smiled in a more kindly way
at the shrewdness of her guess.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t own up, but I know I am right,&#8221; she
said; &#8220;and the way I know it is because I think I&#8217;d feel
just like that myself if some one hurt me bad. I wonder
if girls often feel that way. I guess not. I know Ora
Harrison, the doctor&#8217;s girl, don&#8217;t. She says her prayers
every night, and asks God to let her enemies have good
luck. U&#8217;m! I can&#8217;t do that.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span></p>
<p>The man watched her as she sat silent for a little,
looking out into the still, warm sunshine. The squaw
slumbered on, and the girl stared across her, and her
face grew sad and moody with some hard thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awful to hate,&#8221; she said, at last. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
think it is?&mdash;to hate so that you can&#8217;t breathe right
when the person you hate comes near where you are&mdash;to
be able to <i>feel</i> if he comes near, even when you don&#8217;t
see or hear him, to feel a devil that rises up in your
breast and makes you want to get a knife and cut&mdash;cut
deep, until the blood you hate runs away from the face
you hate, and leaves it white and cold. Ah! it&#8217;s bad, I
reckon, to have some one hate you; but it&#8217;s a thousand
times worse to hate back. It makes the prettiest day
black when the devil tells you of the hate you must
remember, and you can&#8217;t pray it away, and you can&#8217;t
forget it, and you can&#8217;t help it! Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>
<p>She put her hands over her eyes and leaned her head
against his hand. He felt her tears, but could not comfort
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I know&mdash;how you felt,&#8221; she said, trying to
speak steadily. &#8220;Girls shouldn&#8217;t know; girls should have
love and good thoughts taught to them. I&mdash;I&#8217;ve dreamed
dreams of what a girl&#8217;s life ought to be like; something
like Ora&#8217;s home, where her mother kisses her and loves
her, and her father kisses and loves them both. I went
to their home once, and I never could go again. I was
starving for the kind of home she has, and I knew I
never would get it. That is the hardest part of it&mdash;to
know, no matter how hard you try to be good, all your
life, you can&#8217;t get back the good thoughts and the love
that should have been yours when you were little&mdash;the
good thoughts that would have kept hate from growing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
in your heart, until it is stronger than you are. Oh, it&#8217;s
awful!&#8221;</p>
<p>The squaw, who did not understand English, but did
understand tears, rolled over and peered out from her
blanket at the girl who knelt there as at the feet of a
confessor. But the girl did not see her; she still knelt
there, almost whispering now.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the worst of it is, Joe, after they are dead&mdash;the
ones you hate&mdash;then the devil in you commences to torment
you by making you think of some good points
among the bad ones; some little kind word that would
have made the hate in your heart less if it had not been
for your own terrible wickedness. And it gnaws and
torments you just like a rat gnawing the heart out of
a log for a nest. And hate is terrible! whether it is live
hate, or dead, it is terrible. Maybe I won&#8217;t feel so bad
now that I&#8217;ve said out loud to some one how I feel&mdash;how
much harder my heart is than it ought to be. I
couldn&#8217;t tell any one else. But you hate, too, you know.
Maybe you know, too, that dead hate hurts worst&mdash;that
it haunts like a ghost.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at him, and saw again that queer, wise
smile about his lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s dead!&#8221; she said, and her face
grew paler. &#8220;You think he&#8217;s still alive, and that is why
you don&#8217;t want folks to use your old name. You are
laying for him yet, and you so helpless you can&#8217;t move!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man only looked at her grimly. He would not
deny; he would not assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are wrong,&#8221; she persisted. &#8220;He is dead.
The Indians told me so&mdash;Akkomi told me so. Would
they lie to me? Joe, can&#8217;t you let the hate go by, now
that he is dead&mdash;dead?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>But no motion answered her, though his eyes rested
on her kindly enough. Then the squaw arose and
slouched away to pick up firewood in the forest, and
the girl arose, too, and touched his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, whether you can or not, I am glad I told you
what I did. Maybe it won&#8217;t worry me so much now;
for sometimes, just when I&#8217;m almost happy, the ghost
of that bad hate seems to whisper, whisper, and there
ain&#8217;t any more good times for me. I&#8217;m glad I told you.
I would not have, though, if you could talk like other
folks, but you can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>She got him a drink of water, slipped their first find
of the gold into his pocket, and then stood at the tent
door, watching for Overton.</p>
<p>But he did not come, and after a little she picked up
the pan again and started for the small stream where
she had left him.</p>
<p>The man in the chair watched her go, and when she
was out of sight, that right hand was again slowly raised
from the chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;C&mdash;an&#8217;t I?&#8221; he whispered, in a strange, indistinct way.
&#8220;Poor lit&mdash;tle girl! poor little&mdash;girl!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<h3>THE TRACK IN THE FOREST.</h3>
</div>

<p>Their camp was about a mile from the Kootenai River,
and close to a stream of depth sufficient to carry a
canoe; while, a little way north of their camp, a beautiful
spring of clear water gurgled out from under a little
bank, and added its portion to the larger stream that
flowed eastward to the river.</p>
<p>There was a little peculiarity about the spring, which
made it one to remember&mdash;or, rather, two to remember,
for it was really a twin, and its sister stream slipped
from the other side of the narrow ledge and ran north
for a little way, and then turned to the east and emptied
into the Kootenai, not a hundred yards from the stream
into which its mate had run.</p>
<p>The two springs were not twenty feet apart, and lay
direct north and south from each other. Then their
wide curves, in opposite directions, left within their
circle a tract of land like an island, for the streams
bounded it entirely except for that narrow neck of rock
and soil joining it to the bigger hills to the west.</p>
<p>It was in the vicinity of the two springs that the rude
sketch of Harris bade them search; but more definite
directions than that he had not given. He had marked
a tree where the north stream joined the river; and finding
that as a clew, they followed the stream to its
source. When they reached the larger stream, navigable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
for a mile, they concluded to move their tents there, for
no lovelier place could be found.</p>
<p>It was &#8217;Tana and Overton who tramped over the lands
where the streams lay, and did their own prospecting
for location. He was surprised to find her knowledge of
the land so accurate. The crude drawing was as a
solved problem to her; she never once made a wrong
turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve thought over it a heap,&#8221; she said, when
he commented on her clever ideas. &#8220;I saw that marked
tree as we went down to the Ferry, and I remembered
where it was; and the trail is not hard if you only get
started on it right. It&#8217;s getting started right that counts&mdash;ain&#8217;t
it, Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>There seemed fewer barriers between them in the
free, out-of-door life, where no third person&#8217;s views colored
their own. They talked of Lyster, and missed him;
yet Dan was conscious that if Lyster were with them,
he would have come second instead of first in her confidences,
and her friendly, appealing ways.</p>
<p>Whether he trusted her or not, she did not know. He
had not asked a question as to how that survey of the
land came to her; but he watched Harris sometimes
when the girl paid him any little attention, and he could
read only absolute trust in the man&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>Overton was not given to keen analysis of people or
motives; a healthy unconcern pervaded his mind as to
the affairs of most people. But sometimes the girl&#8217;s
character, her peculiar knowledge, her mysterious past,
touched him with a sense of strange confusion, yet in the
midst of the confusion&mdash;the deepest of it&mdash;he had put
all else aside when she appealed to him, and had followed
her lead into the wilderness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span></p>
<p>And as she ran from him with the particles of gold,
and carried them, as he bade her, to Harris, he followed
her with his gaze until she disappeared through the
green wall of the bushes. Once he started to follow her,
and then stopped, suddenly muttered something about a
&#8220;cursed fool,&#8221; and flung himself face down in the tall
grass.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s got to end here,&#8221; he said, aloud, as men grow
used to thinking when they live alone in the woods
much. Then he raised himself on his elbows and looked
over the little grassy dip of the land to where the stream
from the hills sparkled in the warm sun; and then
away beyond to where the evergreens raised their dark
heads along the heights, looking like somber guardians
keeping ward over the sunny valley of the twin springs.
Over them all his gaze wandered, and then up into
the deep forest above him&mdash;a forest unbroken from
there to the swift Columbia.</p>
<p>The perfect harmony of it all must have oppressed
him until he felt himself the one discordant note, for
he closed his eyes with a sigh that was almost a groan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll see it all again&mdash;often, I suppose,&#8221; he muttered;
&#8220;but never quite as it is now&mdash;never, for it&#8217;s got to end.
The little bits of gold I found are a warning of the
changes to come here&mdash;that is the way it seems to me.
Queer how a man will change his idea of life in a year
or so! There have been times when I would have rejoiced
over the prospect of wealth there is here; yet all
I am actually conscious of is regret that everything
must change&mdash;the place&mdash;the people&mdash;all where gold is
king. Pshaw! what a fool I would seem to any one else
if he knew. Yet&mdash;well, I have dreamed all my days of
a sort of life where absolute happiness could be lived.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
Other men do the same, I suppose&mdash;yes, of course. I
wonder if others also come in reach of it too late. I suppose
so. Well, reasoning won&#8217;t change it. I marked
out my own path&mdash;marked it out with as little thought as
many another fool; but I&#8217;ve got to walk in it just the
same, and cursing back don&#8217;t help luck. But I had to
have a little pow-wow all alone and be sorry for myself,
before turning my back on the man I&#8217;d like to be&mdash;and&mdash;the
rest of my dreams that have come in sight for a little
while but can never come nearer&mdash;There she comes
again! I&#8217;m glad of it, for she will at least keep me
from drifting into dreams alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she appeared to be dreaming a little herself. At
any rate, the scene she had passed through in the tent
left memories too dark with feeling to be quickly dispelled,
and he noticed at once the change in her face,
and the traces of tears left about her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has hurt you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! So you leave here jolly enough, and run around
to camp, and cry about nothing&mdash;do you?&#8221; he asked,
with evident unbelief. &#8220;Were you crying for joy over
those little grains of gold&mdash;or over your loneliness in
being so far from the Ferry folks?&#8221;</p>
<p>She laughed at the mere idea of either&mdash;and laughter
dispels tear traces so quickly from faces that are young.
&#8220;Lonely!&#8221; she exclaimed: &#8220;lonely here? why, I feel a
heap more satisfied here than down at the Ferry, where
the whole place smelled like saw-mills and new lumber.
I always had a grudge against saw-mills, for they spoil
all the lovely woods. That is why I like all this,&#8221; and
she made a sweep of her arm, embracing all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
territory in sight; &#8220;for in here not a tree has been touched
with an ax. Lonely here! Why, Dan, I&#8217;ve been so perfectly
happy that I&#8217;m afraid&mdash;yes, I am. Didn&#8217;t you
ever feel like that&mdash;just as if you were too happy to last,
and you were afraid some trouble would come and end
it all?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Overton stooped to lift the pick he had been using,
and so turned his face away from her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad you are not getting blue over lack
of company,&#8221; he remarked; &#8220;for we have only commenced
prospecting, you know, and it will be at least
a week before we can hope to send for any one else to
join us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A week! Do you intend to send for other folks,
then?&#8221; and her tone was one of regret. &#8220;Oh, it would
be all different, then. My pretty camp would be spoiled
for me if folks should come talking and whistling up
our creek. Don&#8217;t let any one know so soon!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know what you are talking of,&#8221; he answered,
a little roughly. &#8220;This is a business trip. We did
not come up here just because we were looking for a
pretty picture of a place to camp in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; and surprise and dismay were in the exclamation.
&#8220;Then you don&#8217;t care for it&mdash;you want other people
just as soon as you find the rich streak where the gold
is? Well&#8221;&mdash;and she looked again over their little chosen
valley&mdash;&#8220;I almost hope you won&#8217;t find it very soon&mdash;not
for several days. I would like to live just like this for
a whole week. And I thought&mdash;I was so sure you liked
it, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he answered, indifferently enough, evidently
giving his whole attention to examining the soil
he had commenced to dig up again, &#8220;I like the camp all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
right, but we can&#8217;t just stand around and admire it, if
we want to accomplish what we came for. And see here,
&#8217;Tana,&#8221; he said, and for the first time he looked at her
with a sort of unwillingness, &#8220;you must know that this
gold is going to make a big change in things for you.
You can&#8217;t live out in the woods with a couple of miners
and an Indian squaw, after your fortune is made&mdash;don&#8217;t
you see that? You must go to school, and live out in the
world where your money will help you to&mdash;well, the
right sort of society for a girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the use of having money if it don&#8217;t help you
to live where you please?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;I thought
that was what money was for. I&#8217;d a heap rather stay
poor here in the woods, with&mdash;with the folks I know,
instead of going where I&#8217;ll have to buy friends with
money. Don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d want the sort of friends who
have to be baited with money, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stared at her helplessly. She was saying to him the
things he had called himself a fool for thinking. But he
could not call her a fool. He could only stifle an impatient
groan, and wonder how he was to reason her into thinking
as other girls would think of wealth and its advantages.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why were you so wild about finding the gold, if you
care so little for the things it brings?&#8221; he demanded, and
she pointed toward the tents.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was for him I thought at first&mdash;of how the money
would, maybe, help to make him well&mdash;get him great
doctors, and all that. The world had been rough on him&mdash;people
had brought him trouble, and&mdash;and I thought,
maybe, I could help clear it away. That was what I had
in my mind at first.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You need things, too, don&#8217;t you?&mdash;not doctors, but
education&mdash;books, beautiful things. You want pictures,
statues, fine music, theaters&mdash;all such things. Well, the
money will help you get them, and get people to enjoy
them with you. I&#8217;ve heard you talk to Max about how
you would like to live, and what you would like to see;
and I think you can soon. But, &#8217;Tana, you will live
then where people will be more critical than we are
here&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;More like Captain Leek?&#8221; she asked, with a deep
wrinkle between her brows; &#8220;for if they are, I&#8217;ll stay
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;N&mdash;no; not like him; and yet they will think considerable
of his sort of ideas, too,&#8221; he answered, blunderingly.
&#8220;One thing sure is this: When your actual
work here is over, you must go at once back to Mrs. Huzzard.
It was necessary for you to come, else I wouldn&#8217;t
have allowed it. But, little girl, when you get among
those fine friends you are going to have, I don&#8217;t want
them to think you had a guardian up here who didn&#8217;t
take the first bit of civilized care of you. And that&#8217;s
what they would think if I let you stay here, just as
though you were a boy. So you see, &#8217;Tana, I just felt
I&#8217;d have to tell you plain that you would have to try and
fit yourself to city ways of living. And when you are a
millionairess, as you count on being, we three partners
can&#8217;t keep on living in tents in the Kootenai woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>She pulled handfuls of the plumy grasses beside her,
and stared sulkily ahead of her. Evidently it was a
great deal for her to understand at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would they blame you&mdash;<i>you</i> for it, if they knew?&#8221;
she asked at last.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they would&mdash;if they knew,&#8221; he said, savagely;
and turning away, he walked across the little grassy
level to where the abrupt little wall or ledge commenced&mdash;the
one from under which the springs flowed.</p>
<p>She thought he was simply out of patience with her.
He was going to the woods&mdash;anywhere to be rid of her
and her stupid ideas; and swift as a bird, she slipped after
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll go, Dan,&#8221; she said reassuringly, catching
his arm. &#8220;So don&#8217;t be vexed at me for being stubborn.
Come! let me look for the gold with you, and then&mdash;then
I&#8217;ll go when you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bargain,&#8221; he said, briefly, and drew his arm
away. &#8220;And if we are going to do any more prospecting
this evening, we had better begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stood facing her, with his back to the bank that
was the first tiny step toward the mountain that rose
dark and shadowy far above. He had walked along
there before, looking with a miner&#8217;s attention to the
lay of the land. Suddenly he uttered an exclamation,
and a light of comprehension brightened his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got a clew to it, sure, &#8217;Tana!&#8221; he said, eagerly.
&#8220;Do you know where we are standing? Well, if I don&#8217;t
make a big mistake, a good-sized river once rolled along
just where we are now. The little creek is all that&#8217;s
left of it. This soil is all a comparatively recent deposit,
and it and the gold dust in it have been washed down
from the mountain. Which means that this little valley
is only a gateway, and the dust we found is only a trail
we are to follow up to the mine from which it came. Do
you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so,&#8221; she answered, looking at the green-covered
banks, and trying to realize how they looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
when a mountain river had cut its way through and
covered all the pretty level where the spring stream
slipped now. &#8220;But doesn&#8217;t that make the gold seem
farther away&mdash;much farther? Will we have to move up
higher in the mountains?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a question I need time to answer, but if I
am right&mdash;if there is a backing of gold ore somewhere
above this old river bed, it means a much surer thing
than an occasional bit of dust washed out of the mud
here. But we won&#8217;t ignore our little placer digging
either. There is an advantage to a poor prospector in
having a claim he can work without any machinery but
a pick, shovel, and pan; while the gold ore needs a fortune
to develop it. Let us go back and talk to Harris,
to see if his evidence substantiates my theory. If not,
we will just stake out our claims on the level, and be
thankful. Later we will investigate the hills.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl walked slowly beside him back to their camp.
The shadows were commencing to lengthen. It was
nearing supper time, and their day had been a busy, tiring
one, for they had moved their camp many miles since
dawn.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very nearly worn out, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked,
as he noticed her tired eyes and her listless step. &#8220;You
see, you would tramp along the shore this morning
when I wanted you to stay in the boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;but I don&#8217;t think that
made me tired. Maybe it&#8217;s the gold we are to find.
How queer it is, Dan, that a person will want and want
some one thing all his life, and he thinks it will make him
so happy; and yet, when at last he gets in sight of it, he
isn&#8217;t happy at all. That is the way I feel about our gold.
I suppose I ought to be singing and laughing and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
dancing for joy. I said I would, too. Yet here I am feeling
as stupid as can be, and almost afraid of the fine life you
say I must go to. Oh, bother! I won&#8217;t think over it
any more. I am going to get supper.&#8221;</p>
<p>For while &#8217;Tana would accept the squaw as an assistant
and a gatherer of fuel, she decidedly declined to
have her installed as head cook. She herself filled that
office with a good deal of girlish conceit, encouraged by
the praise of Overton and the approving nods of Harris.</p>
<p>There had been a fifth member of their party, Flap-Jacks&#8217;
husband. &#8217;Tana had bestowed that name on the
squaw in the very beginning of their acquaintance. But
Overton had sent him on an errand back to Sinna Ferry,
not wishing to have his watchful eyes prying into their
plans in the very beginning of their prospecting. And
it was not until he had started on his journey that the
pick and pan had disclosed the golden secret of the old
river bed.</p>
<p>Harris watched the two approach, and his keen gray
eyes turned with a certain fondness from one to the other.
They were as guardian angels to him, and their mutual
care of him had brought them closer to each other there
in the wilderness than they ever had been in the little
settlement farther down the river.</p>
<p>&#8220;Squaw not here yet?&#8221; asked &#8217;Tana, and at once set
to work preparing things for the supper.</p>
<p>Harris shook his head, but at that moment their hand-maiden
did return, carrying a great load of sticks for
fire, and then brought to the girl a number of fine trout
she had caught almost at their door. She built the fire
outside, where two forked sticks had been driven into
the ground, and across them a pole lay, from which
kettles could be hung. As &#8217;Tana set the coffee pot on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
the hot coals, the Indian woman spoke to her in that low
voice which is characteristic of the red people.</p>
<p>&#8220;More white men to come into camp?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;White men? No. Why do you ask?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see tracks&mdash;not Dan&#8217;s tracks&mdash;not yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Made when?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now&mdash;little while back&mdash;only little.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton heard their voices, though not their words;
and as &#8217;Tana re-entered the wigwam, he glanced around
at her with a dubious smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the first time I ever heard you actually talking
Chinook,&#8221; he observed; &#8220;though I&#8217;ve had an idea
you could, ever since the evening in Akkomi&#8217;s village. It
is like your poker playing, though you have been very
modest about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was not the night I played the captain,&#8221; she
answered; &#8220;and I think you might let me alone about
that, after I gave him back his money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just the part I can not forgive you for,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;He will never get over the idea, now, that you
cheated him, and that your conscience got the better of
you to such an extent that you tried to wipe a sin away
by giving the money back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I did,&#8221; she answered, quietly. &#8220;I had to
settle his conceit some way, for he did bother me a heap
sometimes. But I&#8217;m done with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She seemed rather thoughtful during the frying of the
fish and the slicing down of Mrs. Huzzard&#8217;s last contribution&mdash;a
brown loaf.</p>
<p>She was disturbed over the footprints seen by the
Indian woman&mdash;the track of a white man so close to their
camp that day, yet who had kept himself from their
sight! Such actions have a meaning in the wild
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
countries, and the meaning troubled her. While it would
have been the most simple thing in the world to tell Overton
and have him make a search, something made her
want to do the searching herself&mdash;but how?</p>
<p>&#8220;I was right in my theory about the old river bed,&#8221;
he said to her, as she poured his coffee. &#8220;Harris backs
me up in it, and it was ore he found, and not the loose
dirt in the soil. So the thing I am going to strike out
for is the headquarters where that loose dust comes
from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! then it was ore you found?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Harris nodded his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ore on the surface&mdash;and near here.&#8221;</p>
<p>That news made her even more anxious about that
stranger who had prowled around. Perhaps he, too,
was searching for the hidden wealth.</p>
<p>When the supper was over, and the sun had slipped
back of the mountain, she beckoned to the squaw, and
with the water bucket as a visible errand, they started
toward the spring.</p>
<p>But they did not stop there. She wanted to see with
her own eyes those footprints, and she followed the
Indian down into the woods already growing dusky in
the dying day.</p>
<p>The birds were singing their good-night songs, and all
the land seemed steeped in repose. Only those two
figures, gliding between the trees, carried with them the
spirit of unrest.</p>
<p>They reached an open space where no trees grew
very close&mdash;a bit of marsh land, where the soil was
black and tall ferns grew. The squaw led her straight
to a place where two of the fern fronds were bent and
broken. She parted the green lances, and there beside
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
it was a scraping away of the earth, as though some one
walking there had slipped, and in the black sandy loam
a shoe had sunk deep. The Indian was right; it was
the mark of a white man, for the reds of that country
had not yet adopted the footgear of their more advanced
neighbors.</p>
<p>&#8220;It turn to camp,&#8221; said the squaw. &#8220;Maybe some
white thief, so I tell you. Me tell Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; answered the girl; and, kneeling down, she
studied the slender outline of the foot attentively. &#8220;Any
more tracks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more&mdash;only leaves stirred nearer to camp; he go
that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The full moon rose clear and warm in the east, while
yet the sun&#8217;s light lingered over the wilderness. Beautiful
flowers shone white and pink and yellow in the
opaline light of the evening; and &#8217;Tana mechanically
plucked a few that touched her as she passed, but she
gave little notice to their beauty. All her thought was
on the slender footprint of the man in the woods, and
her face looked troubled.</p>
<p>They walked on, looking to right and left in any nook
where deep shadows lay, but never a sign could they see
of aught that was human besides themselves, until they
neared the springs again, when the squaw laid her hand
on the arm of the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan,&#8221; she said, in her low, abrupt way.</p>
<p>The girl, looking up, saw him a little way ahead of
them, standing there straight, strong, and surely to be
trusted; yet her first impulse was to tell him nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the water and go,&#8221; she said to the Indian, and
the woman disappeared like a mere wraith of a woman
in the pale shadows.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go so far next time when you want to pick
flowers in the evening,&#8221; said Overton, as &#8217;Tana came
nearer to him. &#8220;You make me realize that I have nerves.
If you had not come in sight the instant you did, I should
have been after you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But nothing will harm us; I am not afraid, and it is
pretty in the woods now,&#8221; she answered lamely, and
toyed with the flowers. But the touch of her fingers was
nervous, and the same quality trembled in her voice. He
noticed it and reaching out took her hand in his very
gently, and yet with decision that forced her to look up at
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little girl&mdash;what is it? You are sick?&#8221;</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am not&mdash;I am not sick,&#8221; and she tried to free
her hand, but could not.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana,&#8221; and his teeth closed for a moment on his lip
lest he say all the warm words that leaped up from
his heart at sight of her face, which looked startled and
pale in the moonlight&mdash;&#8220;&#8217;Tana, you won&#8217;t need me very
long; and when you go away, I&#8217;ll never try to make you
remember me. Do you understand, little girl? But
just now, while we are so far off from the rest of the
world, won&#8217;t you trust me with your troubles&mdash;with the
thoughts that worry you? I would give half of my life
to help you. Half of it! Ah, good God! all of it!
&#8217;Tana&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>In his voice was all the feeling which compels sympathy,
or else builds up a wall that bars it out. But in
the eyes of the girl, startled though she was, no resistance
could be read. Her hand was in his, her face lifted to
him, and alight with sudden gladness. In his eyes she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
read the force of an irresistible power taking possession
of a man&#8217;s soul and touching her with its glory.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana!&#8221; he said very softly, in a tone she had never
before heard Dan Overton use&mdash;a tone hushed and reverent
and appealing. &#8220;<i>&#8217;Tana!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Did he guess all the stormy emotions locked alone in the
girl&#8217;s heart, and wearing out her strength? Did he guess
all the childish longing to feel strong, loving arms
around her as a shield? His utterance of her name
drew her to him. His arm fell around her shoulders,
and her head was bowed against his breast. The hat
she wore had fallen to the ground, and as he bent over
her, his hand caressed her hair tenderly, but there was
more of moody regret than of joy in his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana, my girl! poor little girl!&#8221; he said softly.</p>
<p>But she shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;not so poor now,&#8221; she half whispered and looked
up at him&mdash;&#8220;not so very poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she uttered a half-strangled scream of terror
and broke away from him; for across his shoulder she
saw a face peering at her from the shadows of the over-hanging
bushes above them, a white, desperate face, at
sight of which she staggered back and would have
fallen had Overton not caught her.</p>
<p>He had not seen the cause of her alarm, and for one
instant thought it was himself from whom she shrank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me&mdash;what is it?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;&#8217;Tana, speak
to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not speak, but a rustle in the bushes above
them caught his ear; and looking up, he saw a form pass
lightly through the shadows and away from them. He
could not tell whether it was an Indian, a white man,
or even an animal scampering off that way through the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
bushes. But anything that spied like that and ran when
discovered was a thing to shoot at. He dropped his
hand to his revolver, but she caught his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Dan! Oh, don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t shoot him!&#8221;</p>
<p>He stared at her, conscious that it was no ordinary
fear that whitened her face. What did it mean? She
herself had just come from the woods&mdash;pale, agitated,
and with only a semblance of flower gathering to explain
her absence. Had she met some one there&mdash;some one
who&mdash;</p>
<p>He let go of her and started to run up the side of the
steep bank; but swiftly as he moved, she caught him and
clung to him, half sobbing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go! Oh, Dan, let him go!&#8221; she begged, and her
grasp made it impossible for him to go unless he picked
her up and carried her along.</p>
<p>He stooped, took her head roughly in his hands, and
turned her face up, so that the light would fall upon it.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Him!</i> Then you know who it is?&#8221; he said, grimly.
&#8220;What sort of business is this, &#8217;Tana? Are you going
to tell me?&#8221;</p>
<p>But she only crouched closer to him, and, sobbing,
begged him not to go. Once he tried to break away
but lost his footing, and the soil and bits of boulders
went clattering down past her.</p>
<p>With a muttered oath of impatience, he gave up the
pursuit, and stared down at her with an expression more
bitter than any she had ever seen on his face before.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are bound to protect him, are you?&#8221; he asked,
coldly. &#8220;Very well. But if you value him so highly you
had better keep him clear of this camp, else he&#8217;ll find
himself ready for a box. Come! get up and go to the
tents. That is a better place for you than here. Your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
coming out here this evening has been a mistake all
around&mdash;or else mine has. I wish to Heaven I could
undo it all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood a little apart from him, but her hand was
still outstretched and clasping his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;All, Dan?&#8221; she asked, and her mouth trembled. But
his own lips were firm enough, as he nodded his head
and looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;All,&#8221; he said briefly. &#8220;Go now; and here are your
flowers for which you hunted so long in the woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stooped to pick them up for her from where they
had fallen&mdash;the white, fragrant things he had thought so
beautiful as she came toward him with them in the
moonlight.</p>
<p>But as he lifted them from the bank, where they were
scattered, he saw something else there which was neither
beautiful nor fragrant, but over which he bent with
earnest scrutiny. An ordinary looking piece of shale or
stone it would have seemed to an inexperienced eye,
a thing with irregular veins of a greenish appearance,
and the green dotted plainly with yellow&mdash;so plainly
as to show even in the moonlight the nature of the find.</p>
<p>He turned to the girl and reached it to her with the
flowers.</p>
<p>&#8220;There! When my foot slipped I broke off that bit
of &#8217;float&#8217; from the ledge,&#8221; he said curtly. &#8220;Show it to
Harris. We have found the gold ore, and I&#8217;ll stake out
the claims to-night. You can afford to leave for civilization
now as soon as you please, I reckon, for your
work in the Kootenai country is over. Your fortune
is made.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<h3>NEW-COMERS.</h3>
</div>

<p>Many days went by after that before more time was
given to the hunting of gold in that particular valley of
the Kootenai lands; for before another day broke, the
squaw spoke at the door of Overton&#8217;s tent and told him
the girl was sick with fever, that she talked as a little
child babbles and laughs at nothing.</p>
<p>He went with her, and the face he had seen so pale
in the moonlight was flushed a rosy red, and her arms
tossed meaninglessly, while she muttered&mdash;muttered!
Sometimes her words were of the gold, and of flowers.
He even heard his name on her lips, but only once; and
then she cried out that he hurt her. She was ill&mdash;very
ill; he could see that, and help must be had.</p>
<p>He went for it as swiftly as a boat could be sped over
the water. During the very short season of waiting for
the doctor and Mrs. Huzzard, he wrote to Lyster, and
secured some Indians for work needed. If the doctor
thought her able for the journey, he meant to have her
brought back in a boat to Sinna Ferry, where she would
have something more substantial than canvas walls about
her.</p>
<p>But the doctor did not. He was rather mystified by
her sudden illness, as there had been no forewarnings
of it. That it was caused by some shock was possible;
and that it was serious was beyond doubt.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>The entire party, and especially Mrs. Huzzard, were
taken aback by finding a newly arrived, self-imposed
guardian at the door of Tana&#8217;s tent. It was the blanket-draped
figure of old Akkomi, and his gaily painted canoe
was pulled up on the bank of the creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard on the wind the child was sick,&#8221; he said
briefly to Overton. &#8220;I come to ask if you needed help.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Overton looked at him suspiciously. It was impossible
that he could have heard of her illness so soon,
though he might have heard of her presence there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Were any of your people here at nightfall yesterday?&#8221;
he asked. The old fellow shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, none of my people,&#8221; he said briefly; then he
puffed away at his pipe, and looked approvingly at Mrs.
Huzzard, who tried to pass him without turning her
back to him at all, and succeeded in making a circuit
bearing some relation to progress made before a throne,
though the relationship was rather strained. His approving
eyes filled her with terror; for, much as she had
reveled in Indian romances (on paper) in her youth, she
had no desire to take any active part in them in her middle
age.</p>
<p>And so, with the help of the doctor and Mrs. Huzzard,
they commenced the nursing of &#8217;Tana back to consciousness
and health. Night after night Dan walked
alone in the waning moonlight, his heart filled with remorse
and blame for which he could find no relief. The
gathering of the gold had no longer allurements for him.</p>
<p>But he moved Harris&#8217; tent on to one of the claims,
and he cut small timber, and in a day and a half had a
little log house of two rooms put up and chinked with
dry moss and roofed with bark, that &#8217;Tana might have
a home of her own, and have it close to where the ore
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
streaked with gold had been found. Then he sent the
Indians up the river again, and did with his own hands
all labor needed about the camp.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be sick yourself, Overton,&#8221; growled the doctor,
who slept in the tent with him, and knew that scarce an
hour of the night passed that he was not at the door of
&#8217;Tana&#8217;s cabin, to learn if any help was needed, or merely
to stand without and listen to her voice as she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;For mercy&#8217;s sake, Mr. Dan, do be a little careful of
yourself,&#8221; entreated Mrs. Huzzard; &#8220;for if you should
get used up, I don&#8217;t know what I ever would do here in
this wilderness, with &#8217;Tana and the paralyzed man and
you to look after&mdash;to say nothing of the fear I&#8217;m in every
hour because o&#8217; that nasty beast of an Indian that you
say is a chief. He is here constant!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Proof of your attractive powers,&#8221; said Overton, reassuringly.
&#8220;He comes to admire you, that is all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And enough, too! And if it wasn&#8217;t for you that&#8217;s
here to protect me, the good Lord only knows whether
I&#8217;d ever see a milliner shop or a pie again, as long as I
lived. So I am set on your taking more care of yourself&mdash;now
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait until you have cause, before you worry,&#8221; he
advised, &#8220;I don&#8217;t look like a sick man, do I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look like a well one, anyway,&#8221; she said,
looking at him carefully; &#8220;and you don&#8217;t look as I ever
saw you look before. You are as hollow eyed as though
you had been sick yourself for a month. Altogether,
I think your coming out here to camp in the wild woods
has been a big mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like it just now,&#8221; he agreed, and his eyes,
tired and troubled, looked past her into the cabin where
&#8217;Tana lay. &#8220;Does she seem better?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just about the same. Eight days now since she was
took down; and the doctor, he said to-morrow would be
the day to hope for a change, either for the better or&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>But the alternative was not a thing easy for the good
soul to contemplate, and she left the sentence unfinished
and disappeared into the cabin again, while the man
outside dropped his head in his hands, feeling the most
helpless creature in all the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better to-morrow, or&mdash;worse;&#8221; that was what Mrs.
Huzzard meant, but could not utter. Better or worse!
And if the last, she might be dying now, each minute!
And he was powerless to help her&mdash;powerless even to
utter all the regret, the remorse, the heart-aching sorrow
that was with him, for her ears were closed to the
sense of words, and his lips were locked by some key
of some past.</p>
<p>His own judgment on himself was not light as he
went over in his mind each moment of their hours together.
Poor little &#8217;Tana! poor little stray!</p>
<p>&#8220;I promised not to question her; yes, I promised that,
or she would never have left the Indians with me. And
I&mdash;I was savage with her, just because she would not
tell me what she had a perfect right to keep from me if
she chose. Even if it was&mdash;a lover, what right had I to
object? What right to hold her hands&mdash;to say all the
things I said? If she were a woman, I could tell her
all I think&mdash;all, and let her judge. But not as it is&mdash;not
to a girl so young&mdash;so troubled&mdash;so much of a stray.
Oh, God! she shall never be a stray again, if only she
gets well. I&#8217;d stay here digging forever if I could only
send her out in the world among people who will make
her happy. And she&mdash;the child, the child! said she
would rather live here as we did than to have the gold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
that would make her rich. God! it is hard for a man to
forget that, no matter what duty says.&#8221;</p>
<p>So his thoughts would ramble on each day, each
night, and his restlessness grew until Harris took to
watching him with a great pity in his eyes, and mutely
asked each time he entered if hope had grown any
stronger.</p>
<p>By the request of Mrs. Huzzard they had moved Harris
into the other room of the cabin, because of a rain
which fell one night, and reminded them that his earthen
floor might prove injurious to his health. Mrs. Huzzard
declared she was afraid, with that room empty;
and Harris, though having a partially dead body, had
at least a living soul, and she greatly preferred his
presence to the spiritless void and the fear of Indian occupancy.</p>
<p>So she shared the room with &#8217;Tana, and the doctor and
Overton used one tent, while the squaw used the other.
All took turns watching at night beside the girl, who
never knew one from the other, but who talked of gold&mdash;gold
that was too heavy a load for her to carry&mdash;gold
that ran in streams where she tried to find water to drink
and could not&mdash;gold that Dan thought was better than
friends or their pretty camp. And over those woes she
would moan until frightened from them by ghosts, the
ghosts she hated, and which she begged them so piteously
to keep out of her sight.</p>
<p>So they had watched her for days, and toward the
evening of the eighth Overton was keeping an ever-watchful
ear for the Indian and the doctor who had
gone personally to fetch needed medicines from the settlement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span></p>
<p>Akkomi was there as usual. Each day he would
come, sit in the doorway of the Harris cabin for hours,
and contemplate the helpless man there. When evening
arrived he would enter his canoe and go back to his own
camp, which at that time was not more than five miles
away.</p>
<p>Overton, fearing that Harris would be painfully annoyed
by the presence of this self-invited visitor, offered
to entertain him in his own tent, if Harris preferred.
But while Harris looked with no kindly eye on the old
fellow, he signified that the Indian should remain, if he
pleased. This was a decision so unexpected that Overton
asked Harris if he had ever met Akkomi before.</p>
<p>He received an affirmative nod, which awakened his
curiosity enough to make him question the Indian.</p>
<p>The old fellow nodded and smoked in silence for a
little while before making a reply; then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, one summer, one winter ago, the man worked
in the hills beyond the river. Our hunters were there
and saw him. His cabin is there still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;White man, stranger,&#8221; answered Akkomi briefly.
&#8220;This man stranger, too, in the Kootenai country&mdash;stranger
from away somewhere there,&#8221; and he pointed
vaguely toward the east. &#8220;Name&mdash;Joe&mdash;so him called.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the other man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Other man stranger, too&mdash;go way&mdash;never come back.
This one go away, too; but he come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is all you know of them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All. Joe not like Indian friends,&#8221; and the old fellow&#8217;s
eyes wrinkled up in the semblance of laughter;
&#8220;too much tenderfoot, maybe.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But Joe&#8217;s partner,&#8221; persisted Overton, &#8220;he was not
tenderfoot? He had Indian friends on the Columbia
River.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; agreed the old fellow, and his sly, bead-like
eyes turned toward his questioner sharply and were as
quickly withdrawn, &#8220;maybe so. They hunt silver over
there. No good.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just inside the door Harris sat straining his ears to
catch every word, and Akkomi&#8217;s assumption of bland
ignorance brought a rather sardonic smile to his face,
while his lips moved in voiceless mutterings of anger.
Impatience was clearly to be read in his face as he waited
for Overton to question further, and his right hand
opened and closed in his eagerness.</p>
<p>But no other questions were asked just then; for
Overton suddenly walked away, leaving the crafty-eyed
Akkomi alone in his apparent innocence of Joe&#8217;s past or
Joe&#8217;s partner.</p>
<p>The old fellow looked after him kindly enough, but
shook his head and smoked his dirty black pipe, while
an expression of undivulged knowledge adorned his
withered physiognomy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Dan, no,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Akkomi good friend
to little sick squaw and to you; but he not tell&mdash;not tell
all things.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then his ears, not so keen as in years gone by, heard
sounds on the water, sounds coming closer and closer.
But Dan&#8217;s younger ears had heard them first, and it was
to learn the cause that he had left so abruptly and walked
to the edge of the stream.</p>
<p>It was the doctor and the Indian boatman who came
in sight first around the bend of the creek. Back of them
was another canoe, but a much larger, much more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
pretentious one. In this was Lyster and a middle-aged gentleman
of rather portly build, who dressed in a fashion
very fine when compared with the average garb of the
wilderness.</p>
<p>Overton watched with some surprise the approach of
the man, who was an utter stranger to him, and yet who
bore a resemblance to some one seen before. A certain
something about the shape of the nose and general contour
of the face seemed slightly familiar. He had time
to notice, also, that the hair was auburn in color, and
inclined to curl, and that back of him sat a female form.
By the time he had made these observations, their boat
had touched the shore, and Lyster was shaking his hand
vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got your letter, telling me of your big strike. It
caught me before I was quite started for Helena, so I just
did some talking for you where I thought it would do the
most good, old fellow, and turned right around and
came back. I&#8217;ve been wild to hear about &#8217;Tana. How is
she? This is my friend, Mr. T. J. Haydon, my uncle&#8217;s
partner, you know. He has made this trip to talk a little
business with you, and when I learned you were not
at the settlement, but up here in camp, I thought it would
be all right to fetch him along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it is all right,&#8221; answered Overton, assuringly.
&#8220;Our camp has a welcome for your friend even
if we haven&#8217;t first-class accommodations for him. And
is this lady also a friend?&#8221;</p>
<p>For Lyster, forgetful of his usual gallantry, had allowed
the doctor to assist the other voyager from the
canoe&mdash;a rather tall lady of the age generally expressed
as &#8220;uncertain,&#8221; although the certainty of it was an indisputable
fact.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>A rather childish hat was perched upon her thin but
carefully frizzed hair, and over her face floated a white
veil, that was on a drawing string around the crown of
the hat and drooped gracefully and chastely over the
features beneath, after the fashion of 1860. A string
of beads adorned the thin throat, and the rest of her
array was after the same order of elegance.</p>
<p>The doctor and Lyster exchanged glances, and Lyster
was silently proclaimed master of ceremonies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; he said, easily. &#8220;Pardon me that I am neglectful,
and let me introduce you to Miss Slocum&mdash;Miss
Lavina Slocum of Cherry Run, Ohio. She is the
cousin of our friend, Mrs. Huzzard, and was in despair
when she found her relative had left the settlement; so
we had the pleasure of her company when she heard we
were coming direct to the place where Mrs. Huzzard was
located.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She will be glad to see you, miss,&#8221; said Overton,
holding out his hand to her in very hearty greeting.
&#8220;Nothing could be more welcome to this camp just now
than the arrival of a lady, for poor Mrs. Huzzard has
been having a sorry siege of care for the last week.
If you will come along, I will take you to her at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gathering up her shawl, parasol, a fluffy, pale pink
&#8220;cloud,&#8221; and a homemade and embroidered traveling
bag, he escorted her with the utmost deference to the
door of the log cabin, leaving Lyster without another
word.</p>
<p>That easily amused gentleman stared after the couple
with keen appreciation of the picture they presented.
Miss Slocum had a queer, mincing gait which her long
limbs appeared averse to, and the result was a little
hitchy. But she kept up with Overton, and surveyed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
him with weak blue eyes of gratitude. He appeared to
her a very admirable personage&mdash;a veritable knight of
the frontier, possibly a border hero such as every natural
woman has an ideal of.</p>
<p>But to Lyster, Dan with his arms filled with female
trappings and a lot of pink zephyr blown about his face
and streaming over his shoulder, like a veritable banner
of Love&#8217;s color, was a picture too ludicrous to be lost.
He gazed after them in a fit of delight that seemed likely
to end in apoplexy, because he was obliged to keep his
hilarity silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just look at him!&#8221; he advised, in tones akin to a stage
whisper. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t he a great old Dan? And maybe you
think he would not promenade beside that make-up just
as readily on Broadway, New York, or on Chestnut
street, Philadelphia? Well, sir, he would! If it was
necessary that some man should go with her, he would
be the man to go, and Heaven help anybody he saw
laughing! If you knew Dan Overton twenty years you
would not see anything that would give you a better
key to his nature than just his manner of acting cavalier
to that&mdash;wonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mr. Haydon did not appear to appreciate the
scene with the same degree of fervor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; he said, turning his eyes with indifference to
the two figures, and with scrutiny over the little camp-site
and primitive dwellings. &#8220;Am I to understand,
then, that your friend, the ranger, is a sort of modern
Don Juan, to whom any order of femininity is acceptable?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Lyster, facing about suddenly. &#8220;And if
my thoughtless manner of speech would convey such
an idea of Dan Overton, then (to borrow one of Dan&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
own expressions) I deserve to be kicked around God&#8217;s
footstool for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when you speak of his devotion to any sort of
specimen&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; agreed Lyster. &#8220;I see my words were
misleading&mdash;especially to one unaccustomed to the life
and people out here. But Dan, as Don Juan, is one of
the most unimaginable things! Why, he does not seem
to know women exist as individuals. This is the only
fault I have to find with him; for the man who does not
care for some woman, or never has cared for any woman,
is, according to my philosophy, no good on earth. But
Dan just looks the other way if they commence to give
him sweet glances&mdash;and they do, too! though he thinks
that collectively they are all angels. Yes, sir! let the
worst old harridan that ever was come to Overton with
a tale of virtue and misfortune, and he will take off his
hat and divide up his money, giving her a good share,
just because she happens to be a woman. That is the
sort of devotion to women I had reference to when I
spoke first; the wonder to me is that he has not been
caught in a matrimonial noose long ere this by some
thrifty maid or matron. He seems to me guileless game
for them, as his sympathy is always so easily touched.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps he is keeping free from bonds that he may
marry this ward of his for whom he appears so troubled,&#8221;
remarked Mr. Haydon.</p>
<p>Lyster looked anything but pleased at the suggestion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think he would like to hear that said,&#8221; he returned.
&#8220;&#8217;Tana is only a little girl in his eyes&mdash;one left
in his charge at the death of her own people, and one
who appeals to him very strongly just now because of
her helplessness.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Mr. Haydon, with a slight smile, &#8220;I appear
to be rather unfortunate in all my surmises over
the people of this new country, especially this new camp.
I do not know whether it is because I am in a stupid
mood, or because I have come among people too peculiar
to be judged by ordinary standards. But the thing I am
interested in above and beyond our host and his <i>protégée</i>
is the gold mine he wrote you to find a buyer for.
I think I could appreciate that, at least, at its full value,
if I was allowed a sight of the output.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor had hurried to the cabin even before Overton
and Miss Slocum, so the two gentlemen were left by
themselves, to follow at their leisure. Mr. Haydon
seemed a trifle resentful at this indifferent reception.</p>
<p>&#8220;One would think this man had been making big deals
in gold ore all his life, and was perfectly indifferent as
to whether our capital is to be used to develop this find
of his,&#8221; he remarked, as they approached the cabin. &#8220;Did
you not tell me he was a poor man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. Poor in gold or silver of the United States
mint,&#8221; agreed Lyster, with a strong endeavor to keep
down his impatience of this magnate of the speculative
world, this wizard of the world of stocks and bonds,
whom his partners deferred to, whose nod and beck
meant much in a circle of capitalists. &#8220;I myself, when
back East,&#8221; thought Lyster to himself, &#8220;considered Haydon
a wonderful man, but he seems suddenly to have
grown dwarfed and petty in my eyes, and I wonder that
I ever paid such reverence to his judgment.&#8221;</p>
<p>He smiled dubiously to himself at the consciousness
that the wide spirit of the West must have already
changed his own views of things somewhat, since once
he had thought this marketer of mines superior.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But no one out here would think of calling Dan
Overton poor,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;simply because he is not
among the class that weighs a man&#8217;s worth by the dollars
he owns. He is considered one of the solid men of the
district&mdash;one of the best men to know. But no one
thinks of gauging his right to independence by the
amount of his bank account.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Haydon shrugged his shoulders, and tapped his
foot with the gold-headed umbrella he carried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. I suppose it seems very fine in young minds
and a young country, to cultivate an indifference to
wealth; but to older minds and civilization it grows to
be a necessity. Is that object over there also one of
the solid men of the community?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Akkomi he had reference to, and the serene
manner with which the old fellow glanced over them,
and nonchalantly smoked his pipe in the doorway, did
give him the appearance of a fixture about the camp, and
puzzled Lyster somewhat, for he had never before met
the ancient chief.</p>
<p>He nodded his head, however, saying &#8220;How?&#8221; in
friendly greeting, and the Indian returned the civility
in the same way, but gave slight attention to the speaker.
All the attention of his little black eyes was given to
the stranger, who did not address him, and whose gaze
was somewhat critical and altogether contemptuous.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Huzzard, without waiting for them to reach
the door, hurried out to greet Lyster.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m as glad as any woman can be to see you back
again,&#8221; she said heartily, &#8220;though it&#8217;s more than I hoped
for so soon, and&mdash;Yes, the doctor says she&#8217;s a little
better, thank God! And your name has been on her
lips more than once&mdash;poor dear!&mdash;since she has been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
flighty, and all the thanks I feel to you for bringing
Lavina right along I can never tell you; for it seems a
month since I saw a woman last. I just can&#8217;t count
the squaw! And do you want to come in and look at
our poor little girl now? She won&#8217;t know you; but if
you wish&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I?&#8221; asked Lyster, gratefully. Then he turned
to the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your daughter back home is about the same age,&#8221;
he remarked. &#8220;Will you come in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, certainly,&#8221; answered Mr. Haydon, rather willing
to go anywhere away from the very annoying old redskin
of the pipe and the very&mdash;very scrutinizing eyes.</p>
<p>The doctor and Overton had passed into the room
where Harris was, and Mrs. Huzzard halted at the door
with her cousin, so that the two men approached the
bed alone. The dark form of Akkomi had slipped in
after them like a shadow, but a very alert one, for his
head was craned forward that his eyes might lose never
an expression of the fine stranger&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8217;Tana&#8217;s eyes were closed, but her lips moved voicelessly.
The light was dim in the little room, and Lyster
bent over to look at her, and touched her hot forehead
tenderly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor little girl! poor &#8217;Tana!&#8221; he said, and turned the
covering from about her chin where she had pulled it.
He had seen her last so saucy, so defiant of all his wishes,
and the change to this utter helplessness brought the
quick tears to his eyes. He clasped her hand softly and
turned away.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is too dark in here to see anything very clearly,&#8221;
said the stranger, who bent toward her slightly, with his
hat in his hand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span></p>
<p>Then Akkomi, who had intercepted the light somewhat,
moved from the foot of the bed to the stranger&#8217;s
side, and a little sunshine rifted through the small doorway
and outlined more clearly the girl&#8217;s face on the
pillow.</p>
<p>The stranger, who was quite close to her, uttered a
sudden gasping cry as he saw her face more clearly, and
drew back from the bed.</p>
<p>The dark hand of the Indian caught his white wrist
and held him, while with the other hand he pointed to
the curls of reddish brown clustering around the girl&#8217;s
pale forehead, and from them to the curls on Mr. Haydon&#8217;s
own bared head. They were not so luxuriant as
those of the girl, but they were of the same character,
almost the same color, and the vague resemblance to
something familiar by which Overton had been impressed
was at once located by the old Indian the moment
the stranger lifted the hat from his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sick, maybe die,&#8221; said Akkomi, in a voice that was
almost a whisper&mdash;&#8220;die away from her people, away
from the blood that is as her blood,&#8221; and he pointed to
the blue veins on the white man&#8217;s wrist.</p>
<p>With an exclamation of fear and anger, Mr. Haydon
flung off the Indian&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>Lyster, scarce hearing the words spoken, simply
thought the old fellow was drunk, and was about to
interfere, when the girl, as though touched by the contest
above her, turned mutteringly on the pillow and
opened her unconscious eyes on the face of the stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;See!&#8221; said the Indian. &#8220;She looks at you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! Great God!&#8221; muttered the other and staggered
back out of the range of the wide-open eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>Lyster, puzzled, astonished, came forward to question
his Eastern friend, who pushed past him rudely, blindly,
and made his way out into the sunshine.</p>
<p>Akkomi looked after him with a gratified expression
on his dark, wrinkled old face, and bending over the girl,
he muttered in a soothing way words in the Indian
tongue, as though to quiet her restlessness with Indian
witchery.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<h3>SOMETHING WORSE THAN A GOLD CRISIS.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter with your friend?&#8221; asked Overton,
as Lyster stood staring after Mr. Haydon, who
walked alone down the way they had come from the
boats. &#8220;Is one glimpse of our camp life enough to drive
him to the river again?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no&mdash;that is&mdash;well, I don&#8217;t just know what ails
him,&#8221; confessed Lyster, rather lamely. &#8220;He went in
with me to see &#8217;Tana, and seems all upset by the sight
of her. She does look very low, Dan. At home he has
a daughter about her age, who really resembles her a little&mdash;as
he does&mdash;a girl he thinks the world of. Maybe
that had something to do with his feelings. I don&#8217;t
know, though; never imagined he was so impressionable
to other people&#8217;s misfortunes. And that satanic-looking
old Indian helped make things uncomfortable for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;Akkomi?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that is Akkomi, is it? The old chief who was too
indisposed to receive me when I awaited admittance to
his royal presence! Humph! Well, he seemed lively
enough a minute ago&mdash;said something to Haydon that
nearly gave him fits; and then, as if satisfied with his
deviltry, he collapsed into the folds of his blanket again,
and looks bland and innocent as a spring lamb at the present
speaking. Is he grand chamberlain of your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
establishment here? Or is he a medicine man you depend on
to cure &#8217;Tana?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Akkomi said something to Mr. Haydon?&#8221; asked
Overton, incredulously. &#8220;Nonsense! It could not have
been anything Haydon would understand, anyway, for
Akkomi does not speak English.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyster looked at him from the corner of his eyes, and
whistled rather rudely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, it is not necessary for any reason whatever,
for you to hide the accomplishments of your noble red
friend,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;You are either trying to gull
me, or Akkomi is trying to gull you&mdash;which is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; demanded Overton, impatiently.
&#8220;You look as though there may be a grain of sense in
the immense amount of fool stuff you are talking. Akkomi,
maybe, understands English a little when it is
spoken; but, like many another Indian who does the
same, he will not speak it. I have known him for two
years, in his own camp and on the trail, and I have
never yet heard him use English words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have not had the felicity of even a two-hour
acquaintance with his royal chieftainship,&#8221; remarked
Lyster, &#8220;but during the limited space of time I
have been allowed to gaze on him I am confident I heard
him use five English words, and use them very naturally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you tell me what they were?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly; and I see I will have to&mdash;and maybe bring
proof to indorse me before you will quite credit what I
tell you,&#8221; answered Lyster, with an amused expression.
&#8220;You can scarcely believe a tenderfoot has learned more
of your vagabond reds than you yourself knew, can you?
Well, I distinctly heard him say to Mr. Haydon: &#8216;See!
She looks at you.&#8217; But his other mutterings did not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
reach my ears; they did Haydon&#8217;s, however, and drove
him out yonder. I tell you, Dan, you ought to chain up
your medicine men when capitalists brave the wilds of
the Kootenai to lay wealth at your doorstep, for this
pet of yours is not very engaging.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton paid little heed to the chaffing of his friend.
His gaze wandered to the old Indian, who, as Lyster
said, was at that moment a picture of bland indifference.
He was sunning himself again at the door of Harris&#8217;
cabin, and his eyes followed sleepily the form of Mr.
Haydon, who had stopped at the creek, and with hands
clasped back of him, was staring into the swift-flowing
mountain stream.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t doubt you, Max,&#8221; said Overton, at last.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t speak as if I did. But the idea that old Akkomi
really expressed himself in English would suggest to me a
vital necessity, or else that he was becoming weak in his
old age; for his prejudice against his people using any
of the white men&#8217;s words has been the most stubborn
thing in his whole make-up. And what strong necessity
could there be for him to address Mr. Haydon, an utter
stranger?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know, I am sure&mdash;unless it is that his interest
in &#8217;Tana is very strong. You know she saved the life
of his little grandchild&mdash;the future chief, you said. And
I think you are fond of asserting that an Indian never forgets
a favor; so it may be that his satanic majesty over
there only wanted to interest a seemingly influential
stranger in a poor little sick girl, and was not aware
that he took an uncanny way of doing it. Had we better
go down and apologize to Haydon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&mdash;directly. Who is he?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he is the great moneyed mogul at the back of
the company for whom you have been doing some responsible
work out here. I guess he is what you call
a silent partner; while Mr. Seldon&mdash;my relation, you
know&mdash;has been the active member in the mining deals.
They have been friends this long time. I have heard
that Seldon was to have married Haydon&#8217;s sister years
ago. Wedding day set and all, when the charms of a
handsome employee of theirs proved stronger than her
promise, and she was found missing one morning; also
the handsome clerk, as well as a rather heavy sum of
money, to which the clerk had access. Of course, they
never supposed that the girl knew she was eloping with
a thief. But her brother&mdash;this one here&mdash;never forgave
her. An appeal for help came to him once from her&mdash;there
was a child then&mdash;but it was ignored, and they
never heard from her again. Haydon was very fond of
her, I believe&mdash;fond and proud, and never got over the
disgrace of it. Seldon never married, and he did what
he could to make her family forgive her, and look after
her. But it was no use, though their regard for him
never lessened. So you see they are partners from away
back; and while Haydon is considerable of an expert in
mineralogy, this is the first visit he has ever made to
their works up in the Northwest. In fact, he had not
intended coming so far north just now; he was waiting
for Seldon, who was down in Idaho. But when I got
your letter, and impressed on his mind the good business
policy of having the firm investigate at once, he fell in
with the idea, and&mdash;here we are! Now, that is about all
I can tell you of Haydon, and how he came here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Less would have been plenty,&#8221; said Overton, with a
pretended sigh of relief. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t ask to be told his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
sister&#8217;s love affairs or his brother-in-law&#8217;s failings. I
was asking about the man himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know what to tell you about him; there
doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything to say. He is T. J. Haydon,
a man who inherited both money and a genius for speculation.
Not a plunger, you know; but one of those
pursy, far-seeing fellows who always put their money
on the right number and wait patiently until it wins. I
might tell you that he was sentimental once in his life,
and got married; and I might tell you of a pretty
daughter he has (and whom he used to be very much
afraid I would make love to), but I suppose you would
not be interested in those exciting details, so I will refrain.
But as to the man himself and his trip here, I
can only say, if you have made a strike up here, he is
the very best man I know to get interested. Better even
than Seldon, for Seldon always defers to Haydon, while
Haydon always acts on his own judgment. And say,
old fellow, long as we have talked, you have not yet
told me one word of the new gold mine. I suspected
none of the Ferry folks knew of it, from the general
opinion that your trip here was an idiotic affair. Even
the doctor said there was no sane reason why you should
have dragged Harris and &#8217;Tana into the woods as you
did. I kept quiet, remembering the news in your letter,
for I was sure you did not decide on this expedition
without a good reason. Then the contents of that letter
I read the night Harris collapsed&mdash;well, it stuck in
my mind, and I got to wondering if your bonanza was
the one he had found before. Oh, I&#8217;ve been doing some
surmising about it. Am I right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty nearly,&#8221; assented Overton. &#8220;Of course I knew
some of the folks would raise a howl because I let &#8217;Tana
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
come along; but it was necessary, and I thought it would
be best for her in the end, else you may be sure&mdash;be very
sure&mdash;I would not have had her come. She&mdash;was to
have gone back&mdash;at once&mdash;the very next day; but when
the next day came, she was not able. I have done what
I could, but nothing seems to count. She does not get
well, and the gold doesn&#8217;t play much of a figure in this
camp just now. One-third of the find is hers, and the
same for Harris and me; but I&#8217;d give my share cheerfully
this minute if it would buy back health for her and let
me see her laughing and bright again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyster reached out his hand and gave Overton&#8217;s arm
an affectionate pressure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t I know it, Dan?&#8221; he asked kindly. &#8220;Can&#8217;t I
see that you have just worked and worried yourself sick
over her illness&mdash;blaming yourself, perhaps&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is it&mdash;blaming myself for&mdash;many things,&#8221;
he agreed, brokenly, and then he checked himself as
Lyster&#8217;s curious glance was turned on him. &#8220;So you see
I am in no fit condition to talk values with this Mr.
Haydon. All my thoughts are somewhere else. Doctor
says if she is not better to-night she will not get well.
That means she will not live. Tell your friend that
something worse than a gold crisis is here just now, and
I can&#8217;t talk to him till it is over. Don&#8217;t mind if I&#8217;m even
a bit careless with you, Max. Look after yourselves
as well as you can. You are welcome&mdash;you know that;
but&mdash;what&#8217;s the use of words? Perhaps &#8217;Tana is dying!&#8221;</p>
<p>And turning his back abruptly on his friend, he walked
away, while Lyster looked after him with some surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I seem to be dropped by everybody,&#8221; he remarked,
&#8220;first Haydon and now Dan. But I don&#8217;t believe there
is danger of her dying. I <i>won&#8217;t</i> believe it! Dan has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
worried himself sick and fearful during these terrible
days, but I&#8217;ll do my share now and let him get some rest
and sleep. &#8217;Tana die! I can&#8217;t think it. But I care ten
times more for Dan, just because of his devotion to her.
I wonder what he would think if he knew why I wanted
her to go to school, or how much she was in my mind
every hour I was gone. I felt like telling him just now,
but better not&mdash;not yet. He thinks she is only a little
child yet. Dear old Dan!&#8221;</p>
<p>He entered the cabin and spoke to Harris, whom he
had not seen before, and who looked with pleasure at him,
though, as ever, speechless and moveless, but for that
nod of his head and the bright, quick glance of his eyes.</p>
<p>From him he went again to &#8217;Tana; but she lay still
and pale, with closed eyes and no longer muttering.</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t a blessed thing you can do, Mr. Max,&#8221;
said Mrs. Huzzard, in a wheezing whisper; &#8220;but if there
is, you may be sure I&#8217;ll let you know and glad to do it.
Lavina says she&#8217;s going to help me to a rest; and you
must help Dan Overton, for slept he has not, and I know
it, these eight nights since I&#8217;ve been here. And if that
ain&#8217;t enough to kill a man!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough. But now that I am here, we will not
have any night watches on his part,&#8221; decided Lyster. &#8220;Between
Miss Slocum and myself I think we can manage to
do some very creditable nursing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am willing to do my best,&#8221; said Miss Lavina, with
a shrinking glance toward Flap-Jacks, who just slouched
past with a bucket of water; &#8220;but I must confess I do
feel a timidity in the presence of these sly-looking Indians.
And if at night I can only be sure none of them
are very close, I may be able to watch this poor girl instead
of watching for them with their tomahawks.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never fear while I am detailed as guard,&#8221; answered
Lyster, reassuringly. &#8220;They will reach you only over
my dead body.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but&mdash;&#8221; and the timid one arose as if for instant
flight, but was held by Mrs. Huzzard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, now!&#8221; she said reprovingly to the young fellow,
&#8220;it&#8217;s noways good-natured of you to make us more
scared of the dirty things than we are naturally. But,
Lavina, I&#8217;ll go bail that he never yet has seen a dead
body of their killing since he came in the country. Lord
knows, they don&#8217;t look as if they would kill a sheep,
though they might steal them fast enough. It ain&#8217;t from
Dan Overton that you ever learned to scare women, Mr.
Max; you wouldn&#8217;t catch him at such tricks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I beg that whatever you do, Mrs. Huzzard, you
will not compare me to that personage,&#8221; objected Lyster;
&#8220;for I am convinced that anything human would in your
eyes suffer by such a comparison. Great is Dan in the
camp of the Kootenais!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard only laughed at his words, but Miss
Lavina did not. She even let her eyes wander again to
Akkomi, in order to show her disapproval of frivolous
comment on Mr. Overton; a fact Lyster perceived and
was immensely amused by.</p>
<p>&#8220;She has set her covetous maidenly eyes on him, and
if she doesn&#8217;t marry him before the year is over, he will
have to be clever,&#8221; he decided, as he left them and went
to look up Haydon. &#8220;Serves Dan right if she did, for
he never gives any other fellow half a chance with the
old ladies. The rest of us have to be content with the
young ones.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<h3>THROUGH THE NIGHT.</h3>
</div>

<p>The soft dusk of the night had fallen over the northern
lands, and the pale stars had gleamed for hours on the
reflecting waves of mountain streams. It was late&mdash;near
midnight, for the waning sickle of the moon was
slipping from its dark cover in the east and hanging like
a jewel of gold just above the black crown of the pines.
Breaths from the heights sifted down through the vast
woods, carrying sometimes the dreary twitter of a bird
disturbed, or the mellow call of insects singing to each
other of the summer night. All sounds of the wilderness
were as echoes of rest and utter content.</p>
<p>And in the camp of the Twin Springs, shadows moved
sometimes with a silence that was scarce a discord
in the wood songs of repose. A camp fire glimmered
faintly a little way up from the stream, and around it
slept the Indian boatman, the squaw, and old Akkomi,
who, to the surprise of Overton, had announced his intention
of remaining until morning, that he might know
how the sickness went with the little &#8220;Girl-not-Afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>A dim light showed through the chinks of &#8217;Tana&#8217;s
cabin, where Miss Lavina, the doctor, and Lyster were
on guard for the night. The doctor had grown sleepy
and moved into Harris&#8217; room, where he could be comfortable
on blankets. Lyster, watching the girl, was trying
to make himself think that their watching was all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
of no use; her sleep seemed so profound, so healthfully
natural, that he could not bring himself to think, as Dan
did, that the doctor&#8217;s worst prophecy could come true&mdash;that
out of that sleep she might awake to consciousness,
or that, on the other hand, she might drift from sleep
to lethargy and thus out of life.</p>
<p>Outside a man stood peering in through a chink from
which he had stealthily pulled the moss. He could not
see the girl&#8217;s face, but he could see that of Lyster as he
bent over, listening to her breathing, and he watched
it as if to glean some reflected knowledge from the young
fellow&#8217;s earnest glances.</p>
<p>He had been there a long time. Once he slipped away
for a short distance and stood in the deeper shadows,
but he had returned, and was listening to the low, disjointed
converse of the watchers within, when suddenly
a tall form loomed up beside him and a heavy hand
was dropped on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word!&#8221; said a voice close to his ear. &#8220;If you
make a noise, I&#8217;ll strangle you! Come along!&#8221;</p>
<p>To do otherwise was not easy, for the hand on his
shoulder had a helpful grip. He was almost lifted over
the ground until they were several yards from the cabin,
and out in the clearer light of the stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I protest, Mr. Overton, that your manner is not
very pleasant,&#8221; remarked the captive, as he was released
and allowed to speak. &#8220;Is&mdash;is this sort of threats a habit
of yours with strangers in your camp?&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton, seeing him now away from the thick shadows
of the cabin, gave a low exclamation of astonishment and
irritation.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You</i>&mdash;Mr. Haydon! Well, you must confess that if
my threats are not pleasant, neither is it pleasant to find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
some one moving like a spy around that little girl&#8217;s cabin.
If you don&#8217;t want to be treated like a spy, don&#8217;t act like
one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it does look queer, maybe,&#8221; said the other,
lamely. &#8220;I&mdash;I could not get asleep, and as I was walking
around, it seemed natural to look in the cabin, though I
did not want to disturb them by going in. I think I heard
them say she was improving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did they say that&mdash;lately?&#8221; asked Overton, earnestly,
everything else forgotten for the moment in his strong
desire for her recovery. &#8220;Who said it&mdash;Miss Slocum?
Well, she seems like a sensible woman, and I hope to
God she is right about this! Don&#8217;t mind my roughness
just now. I was too quick, maybe; but spies around a
new gold mine or field are given pretty harsh treatment
up here sometimes; and you were liable to suspicion from
any one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No doubt&mdash;no doubt,&#8221; agreed the other, with visible
relief. &#8220;But to be a suspected character is a new rôle for
me&mdash;a bit amusing, too. However, now that you have
broached the subject of this new find of yours, I presume
Lyster made clear to you that I came up here for the
express purpose of investigating what you have to offer,
with a view to making a deal with you. And as my time
here will be limited&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps to-morrow we can talk of it. I can&#8217;t to-night,&#8221;
answered Overton. &#8220;To that little girl in there
one-third of the stock belongs; another third belongs to
that paralyzed man in the other cabin. I have to look
after the interests of them both, and need to have my head
clear to do it. But with her there sick&mdash;dying maybe&mdash;I
can&#8217;t think of dollars and cents.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You mean to tell me that the young girl is joint
owner of a gold find promising a fortune? Why, I understood
Max to say she was poor&mdash;in fact, indebted
to you for all care.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Max is too careless with his words,&#8221; answered Overton,
coldly. &#8220;She is in my care&mdash;yes; but I do not think
she will be poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She has a very conscientious guardian, anyway,&#8221; remarked
Mr. Haydon, &#8220;when it is impossible for a man
even to look in her cabin without finding you on his track.
I confess I am interested in her. Can you tell me how she
came in this wild country? I did not expect to find pretty
young white girls in the heart of this wilderness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not,&#8221; agreed the other.</p>
<p>They had reached the little camp fire by this time, and
he threw some dry sticks on the red coals. As the blaze
leaped up and made bright the circle around them, he
looked at the stranger and said, bluntly:</p>
<p>&#8220;What did Akkomi tell you of her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Akkomi?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; the old Indian who went in with you to see
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that fellow? Some gibberish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess he must have said that she looks like you,&#8221;
decided Overton. &#8220;I rather think that was it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like <i>me</i>! Why&mdash;how&mdash;&#8221; and Mr. Haydon tried to
smile away the absurdity of such a fancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;For there is a resemblance,&#8221; continued the younger
man, with utter indifference to the stranger&#8217;s confusion.
&#8220;Of course it may not mean anything&mdash;a chance likeness.
But it is very noticeable when your hat is off, and
it must have impressed the old Indian, who seems to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
think himself a sort of godfather to her. Yes, I guess
that was why he spoke to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But her&mdash;her people? Are there only you and these
Indians to claim her? She must have some family&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Possibly,&#8221; agreed Overton, curtly. &#8220;If she ever gets
able to answer, you can ask her. If you want to know
sooner, there is old Akkomi; he can tell you, perhaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Mr. Haydon made a gesture of antipathy to any
converse with that individual.</p>
<p>&#8220;One meets so many astonishing things in this
country,&#8221; he remarked, as though in extenuation of something.
&#8220;The mere presence of such a savage in the sick
girl&#8217;s room is enough to upset any one unused to this
border life&mdash;it upset me completely. You see, I have a
daughter of my own back East.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So Max tells me,&#8221; replied Overton, carelessly, all
unconscious of the intended honor extended to him when
Mr. Haydon made mention of his own family to a ranger
of a few hours&#8217; acquaintance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Haydon continued, &#8220;and that naturally makes
one feel an interest in any young girl without home or&mdash;relatives,
as this invalid is; and I would be glad of
any information concerning her&mdash;or any hint of help
I might be to her, partly for&mdash;humanity&#8217;s sake, and
partly for Max.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At present I don&#8217;t know of any service you could
render her,&#8221; said Overton, coldly, conscious of a jarring,
unpleasant feeling as the man talked to him. He thought
idly to himself how queer it was that he should have an
instinctive feeling of dislike for a person who in the
slightest degree resembled &#8217;Tana; and this stranger must
have resembled her much before he grew stout and
broad of face; the hair, the nose, and other points about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
the features, were very much alike. He did not wonder
that Akkomi might have been startled at it, and made
comments. But as he himself surveyed Mr. Haydon&#8217;s
features by the flickering light of the burning sticks, he
realized how little the likeness of outlines amounted to
after all, since not a shadow of expression on the face
before him was like that of the girl whose sleep was
so carefully guarded in the cabin.</p>
<p>And then, with a feeling of thankfulness that it was
so, there flashed across his mind the import of the
stranger&#8217;s closing words&mdash;&#8220;for the sake of Max.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For Max, you said. Well, maybe I am a little more
stupid than usual to-night, but I must own up I can&#8217;t
see how a favor to &#8217;Tana could affect Max very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you so,&#8221; said Overton curtly, not liking the
knowing smile in the eyes of the speaker. He did not
want to be there talking to him, anyway. To walk
alone under the stars was better than the discord of a
voice unpleasant. Under the stars she had come to him
that once&mdash;once, when she had been clasped close&mdash;close!
when she had whispered words near to his heart,
and their hands had touched in the magnetism of troubled
joy. Ah! it was best to remember that, though death
itself follow after! A short, impatient sigh touched his
lips as he tried to listen to the words of the stranger
while his thoughts were elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;And Seldon would do something very handsome for
Max if he married to suit him,&#8221; Haydon was saying,
thoughtfully. &#8220;Seldon has no children, you know, and
if this girl was sent to school for a while, I think it
would come out all right&mdash;all right. I would take a
personal interest to the extent of talking to Seldon of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
He will think it a queer place for Max to come for a
wife; but when&mdash;when I talk to him, he will agree.
Yes, I can promise it will be all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you talking of?&#8221; demanded Overton, blankly.
He had not heard one-half of a very carefully worded idea
of Mr. Haydon&#8217;s. &#8220;Max married! To whom?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not a very flattering listener,&#8221; remarked the
other, dryly, &#8220;and don&#8217;t show much interest in the love
affairs of your <i>protégeé</i>; but it was of her I was speaking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you would try to marry her to Max Lyster&mdash;marry
her!&#8221; and his voice sounded in his own ears as
strange and far away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it is not an unusual prophecy to make of a
young girl, is it?&#8221; asked Mr. Haydon, with an attempt
to be jocular. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t know where she could find
a better young fellow. From his discourses concerning
her on our journey here and his evident devotion since
our arrival, I fancy the idea is not so new to him as it
seems to be to you, Mr. Overton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense! when she is well, they quarrel as often as
they agree&mdash;oftener.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is no proof that he is not in love with her&mdash;and
why not? She is a pretty girl, a bright girl, he
says, and of good people&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows nothing about her people,&#8221; interrupted
Overton.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know all it has been necessary for me to know,&#8221;
and, in spite of himself, he could not speak of &#8217;Tana to
this man without a feeling of anger at his persistence.
&#8220;But I can&#8217;t help being rather surprised, Mr. Haydon,
that you should so quickly agree that a wise thing for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
your partner&#8217;s nephew to do is to turn from all the cultured,
intelligent girls he must know, and look for a
wife among the mining camps of the Kootenai hills.
And, considering the fact that you approve of it, without
ever having heard her speak, without knowing in
the least who or what her family have been&mdash;I must say
it is an extraordinarily impulsive thing for a man of
your reputation to do&mdash;a cool-headed, conservative business
man.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Haydon found himself scrutinized very closely,
very coldly by the ranger, who had all the evening kept
away from him, and whom he had mentally jotted down
as a big, careless, improvident prospector, untaught and
a bit uncouth.</p>
<p>But his words were not uncouth as he launched them
at the older man, and he was no longer careless as he
watched the perturbation with which they were received.
But Haydon shrugged his shoulders and attempted to
look indifferent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remarked just now that this was a land of astonishing
things,&#8221; he said, with a tolerant air, &#8220;and it surely
is so when the most depraved-looking redskin is allowed
admittance to a white girl&#8217;s chamber, while the most
harmless of Caucasians is looked on with suspicion if
he merely shows a little human interest in her welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Akkomi is a friend of her own choosing,&#8221; answered
Overton, &#8220;and a friend who would be found trusty if
he was needed. As to you&mdash;you have no right, that I
know of, to assume any direction of her affairs. She
will choose her own friends&mdash;and her own husband&mdash;when
she wants them. But while she is sick and helpless,
she is under my care, and even though you were her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
father himself, your ideas should not influence her future
unless she approved you.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a feeling of relief he turned away, glad to have
in some way given vent to the irritation awakened in
him by the prosperous gentleman from civilization.</p>
<p>The prosperous gentleman saw his form grow dim in
the starlight, and though his face flushed angrily at first,
the annoyance gave place to a certain satisfaction as he
seated himself on a log by the fire, and repeated Overton&#8217;s
final words:</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>&#8216;Even though you were her father himself</i>!&#8217; Well,
well, Mr. Overton! Your uncivil words have told me
more than you intended&mdash;namely, that your own knowledge
as to who her father was, or is, seems very slight.
So much the better, for one of your unconventional order
is not the sort of person I should care to have know.
&#8217;Even though you were her father himself.&#8217; Humph!
So he does me the doubtful honor to suppose I may be?
It is a nasty muddle all through. I never dreamed of
walking into such a net as this. But something must
be done, and that is clear; no use trying to shirk it,
for Seldon is sure to run across them sooner or later
up here&mdash;sure. And if he took a hand in it&mdash;as he
would the minute he saw her&mdash;well, I could not count
on his being quiet about it, either. I&#8217;ve thought it all
out this evening. I&#8217;ve got to get her away myself&mdash;get
her to school, get her to marry Max, and all so quietly
that there sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be any social sensation about her advent
into the family. I hardly know whether this wealth
they talk of will be a help or a hindrance; a help, I suppose.
And there need not be any hitch in the whole
affair if the girl is only reasonable and this autocratic
ranger can be ignored or bought over to silence. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
would be very annoying to have such family affairs
talked of&mdash;annoying to the girl, also, when she lives
among people who object to scandals. Gad! how her
face did strike me! I felt as if I had seen a ghost. And
that cursed Indian!&#8221;</p>
<p>Altogether, Mr. Haydon had considerable food for
reflection, and much of it was decidedly annoying; or
so it seemed to Akkomi, who lay in the shadow and
looked like a body asleep, as were the others. But from
a fold of his blanket he could see plainly the face of the
stranger and note the perplexity in it.</p>
<p>The first tender flush of early day was making the
stars dim when the doctor met Overton between the tents
and the cabins, and surveyed him critically from his
slouch hat to his boots, on which were splashes of water
and fresh loam.</p>
<p>&#8220;What, in the name of all that&#8217;s infernal, has taken
possession of you, Overton?&#8221; he demanded, with assumed
anger and real concern. &#8220;You have not been in
bed all night. I know, for I&#8217;ve been to your tent. You
prowl somewhere in the woods when you ought to be in
bed, and you are looking like a ghost of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess I&#8217;ll last a day or two yet, so quit your
growling; you think you&#8217;ll scare me into asking for
some of your medicines; but that is where you will find
yourself beautifully left. I prefer a natural death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will find it, too, if you don&#8217;t mend your
ways,&#8221; retorted the man of the medicines. &#8220;I thought
at first it was the care of &#8217;Tana that kept you awake
every hour of every night; but I see it is just the same
now when there are plenty to take your place; worse&mdash;for
now you go tramping, God only knows where, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
come back looking tired, as though you had been racing
with the devil.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You haven&#8217;t told me how she is,&#8221; was all the answer
he made to this tirade. &#8220;You said&mdash;that by daylight&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There would be a change&mdash;yes, and there is; only
a shadow of a change as yet, but the shadow leans the
right way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>right</i> way,&#8221; he half whispered, and walked on
toward her cabin. He felt dizzy and the tears crept up
in his eyes, and he forgot the doctor, who looked after
him and muttered statements damaging to Dan&#8217;s sanity.</p>
<p>All the long night he had fought with himself to keep
away, to let the others care for her&mdash;the others, who
fancied they were giving him a wished-for rest. And
all the while the desire of his heart was to bar them out&mdash;to
wait, alone with her, for the life or death that was
to come. He had walked miles in his restlessness, but
could not have found again the paths he walked over.
He had talked with some of the people who were wakeful
in the night, but could scarce have told of any words
he had said.</p>
<p>He had felt dazed by the dread of what the new day
would bring, and now he looked up at the morning star
with a great thankfulness in his heart. The new day
had come, and with it a breath of hope.</p>
<p>Miss Lavina met him at the door, and whispered that
the doctor thought the fever had taken the hoped-for
turn for the better. &#8217;Tana had opened her eyes but a
moment before, and looked at Miss Slocum wonderingly,
but fell asleep again; she had looked rational, but
very weak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, old fellow, I am proud of myself,&#8221; said Lyster,
as Overton entered. &#8220;It took Miss Slocum and me only
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
one night to bring &#8217;Tana around several degrees nearer
health. We are the nurses! And if she only wakes
conscious&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>His words, or else the intense, wistful gaze of the
man at the foot of the bed, must have aroused her, for
she moved and opened her eyes and looked around aimlessly,
passing over the faces of Miss Slocum, of the
squaw, and of Overton, until Lyster, close beside her,
whispered her name. Then her lips curved ever so little
in a smile as her eyes met his.</p>
<p>&#8220;Max!&#8221; she said, and put out her hand to him. As
his fingers clasped it, she turned her face toward him,
and fell contentedly asleep again, with her cheek against
his hand.</p>
<p>And Mr. Haydon, who came in with the doctor a
moment later, glanced at the picture they made, and
smiled meaningly at Overton.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see, I was right,&#8221; he observed. &#8220;And do you
not think it would be a very exacting guardian who could
object?&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton only looked at Max, whose face had flushed
a little, knowing how significant his attitude must appear
to others. But his hand remained in hers, and his
eyes turned to Dan with a half embarrassed confession
in them&mdash;a confession Dan read and understood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you may well be proud, Max,&#8221; he said, answering
Lyster&#8217;s words. &#8220;You deserve all gratitude; and I
hope&mdash;I hope nothing but good luck will come your
way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Haydon, who watched him with critical eyes,
could read nothing in his words but kindliest concern
for a friend.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>The doctor, who had suddenly got a ridiculous idea
in his head that Dan Overton was wearing himself out
on &#8217;Tana&#8217;s account, changed his mind and silently called
himself a fool. He might have known Dan had more
sense than that. Yet, what was it that had changed him
so?</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours later he thought he knew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<h3>MISS SLOCUM&#8217;S IDEAS REGARDING DEPORTMENT.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;So it was a gold mine that dragged you people up
into this wilderness? Well, I&#8217;ve puzzled my mind a
good deal to understand your movements lately; but
the finding of a vein as rich as your free gold promises
is enough to turn any man&#8217;s head for a while. Well,
well; you are a lucky fellow, Overton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve no doubt that between good luck and bad
luck, I&#8217;ve as much luck as anybody,&#8221; answered Overton,
with a grimace, &#8220;but a week or so ago you did not think
me lucky&mdash;you thought me &#8216;looney.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are more than half right,&#8221; agreed the doctor;
&#8220;appearances justified me. My wife and I stormed at
you&mdash;behind your back&mdash;for carrying &#8217;Tana with you
on your fishing trip; it was such an unheard-of thing to
my folks, you know. Humph! I wonder what they will
say when it is known that she was on a prospecting trip,
and that the venture will result in a gain to her of dollars
that will be counted by the tens of thousands. By
George! it seems incredible! Just like a chapter from
the old fairy tales.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I find myself thinking about it like that sometimes,&#8221;
said Overton; &#8220;a little afraid to lay plans, for
fear that after all it may be a dream. I never hoped much
for it; I came under protest, and the luck seems more
than I deserved.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe that is the reason you accept it in such a
sulky fashion,&#8221; observed the doctor, &#8220;for, upon my soul,
I think I am more elated over your good fortune than
you are. You don&#8217;t appear to get up a particle of enthusiasm
because of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have not had an enthusiastic lot of partners,
either. Harris, here, not able to move; &#8217;Tana not expected
to live; and I suddenly face to face with all this
responsibility for them. It gave me considerable to
think about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right. I only wonder you are not gray-haired.
A new gold-field waiting for you to make it
known, and you guarding it at the same time, perhaps,
from red tramps who come spying around. But you
are lucky, Dan; everything comes your way, even a
capitalist ready at your word to put up money on the
strength of the ore you have to show. Why, man, many
a poor devil of a prospector has stood a long siege with
starvation, even with gold ore in sight, just because no
one with capital would buy or back him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know. I realize that; and, for the sake of the
other two, I am very glad there need be no waiting for
profits.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know, Dan, I fancy little &#8217;Tana is in the way
of being well cared for, even without this good fortune,&#8221;
observed the doctor, looking at the other in a questioning
way. &#8220;It just occurred to me yesterday that that
fine young fellow, Lyster, is uncommonly fond of her.
It may be simply because she is ill, and he is sorry for
her; but his devotion appeared to me to have a sentimental
tinge, and I thought what a fine thing it would
be.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Very,&#8221; agreed Overton; &#8220;and you are sentimental
enough yourself to plan it all out for them. I guess
Haydon helped to put that notion into your head, didn&#8217;t
he?&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes, he did speak of Lyster&#8217;s devotion to your
<i>protégée</i>&#8221; he acknowledged; &#8220;and you think we are a
couple of premature match-makers, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think maybe you had better leave it for &#8217;Tana to
decide,&#8221; answered Overton, &#8220;and I also think schools
will be the first thing considered by her. She is very
young, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seventeen, perhaps,&#8221; hazarded the doctor; but Overton
did not reply.</p>
<p>He was watching the canoe just launched by their
Indian boatmen. They were to take Mr. Haydon back
again to the Ferry. He was to send up workmen, and
Overton was to manage the work for the present&mdash;or, at
least, until Mr. Seldon could arrive and organize the
work of developing the vein that Mr. Haydon had
found was of such exceeding richness that his offer
to the owners had been of corresponding magnitude.
Overton had promptly accepted the terms offered; Harris
agreed to them; and even if &#8217;Tana should not, Dan
decided that out of his own share he could make up
any added sum desired by her for her share, though he
had little idea that she would find fault with his arrangements.
She! who had thought, that day of the gold find,
that it was better to have their little camp unshared by
the many whom gold would bring to them&mdash;that it was
almost better to be poor than to have their happy life
changed.</p>
<p>And it was all over now. Other people had come and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
were close about her, while he had not seen her since
the morning before, when she had awakened and turned
to Max. Well, he should be satisfied, so he told himself.
She was going to get well again. She was going to be
happy. More wealth than they had hoped for had come
to her, and with it she would, of course, leave the hills,
would go into the life of the cities, and by and by would
be glad to forget the simple, primitive life they had
shared for the few days of one Kootenai summer. Well,
she would be happy.</p>
<p>And here on the spot where their pretty camp had
been, he would remain. No thought of leaving came
to him. It would all be changed, of course; men and
machinery would spoil all the beauty of their wilderness.
But as yet no plan for his own future had occurred to
him. That he himself had wealth sufficient to secure
him from all toil and that a world of pleasure was within
his reach, did not seem to touch him with any alluring
sense. He was going to remain until the vein of the
Twin Springs had a big hole made in it; and the rich
soil of the old river he had staked out as a reserve for
himself and his partners, to either work or sell. Through
his one-sided conversations with Harris he learned that
he, too, wanted to remain in the camp where their gold
had been found. Doctors, medicines, luxuries, could be
brought to him, but he would remain.</p>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard had at once been offered a sum that in
her eyes was munificent, for the express purpose of
managing the establishment of the partners&mdash;when it
was built. Until then she was to draw her salary, and
act as either nurse or cook in the rude dwellings that
for the present had to satisfy all their dreams of luxury.</p>
<p>An exodus from Sinna Ferry was expected; many
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
changes were to be made; and Overton and the doctor
went down to the canoe to give final directions to their
Indian messenger.</p>
<p>Lyster was there, too, with a most exhausting list of
articles which Mr. Haydon was to send up from Helena.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan, some of these things I put down for &#8217;Tana, as
I happened to think of them,&#8221; he said, and unfolded a
little roll made from the leaves of a notebook stuck together
at the ends with molasses. &#8220;You look it over
and see if it&#8217;s all right. I left one sheet empty for anything
you might want to add.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dan took it, eying dubiously the length of it and the
great array of articles mentioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I had better add anything to it until
heavier boats are carrying freight on the Kootenai,&#8221; he
remarked, and then commenced reading aloud some of
the items:</p>

<div class='blockquot'>
<p>A traveling dress for a girl. (Here followed measurements
and directions to the dressmaker.) Then the
whole was scratched out, and the following was substituted:
Brown flannel or serge&mdash;nine yards.</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;I had to get Mrs. Huzzard to tell me some of the
things,&#8221; said Lyster, who looked rather annoyed at the
quizzical smiles of Dan and the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;I should imagine you would,&#8221; observed Overton. &#8220;I
would have needed the help of the whole camp to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
together that amount of plunder. A good shaving set
and a pair of cork insoles, No. 8, are they for &#8217;Tana,
too?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Lyster disdained reply, and Overton, after reading,
&#8220;All the late magazines,&#8221; and &#8220;A double kettle for
cooking oatmeal,&#8221; folded up the paper and gave it back.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I have read only a very small section of the list,
I do not imagine you have omitted anything that could
possibly be towed up the river,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it is all
right, my boy. I would never have thought of half that
stuff, but I&#8217;ve no doubt they will all be of use, and &#8217;Tana
will thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How soon do you expect she will be able to walk,
or be moved?&#8221; asked Mr. Haydon of the doctor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, in two or three weeks, if nothing interferes with
her promised recovery. She is a pretty sick girl; but
I think her good constitution will help her on her feet
by that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And by that time I will be back here,&#8221; said Haydon,
addressing Lyster.</p>
<p>He took a sealed envelope from an inner pocket and
gave it to the young fellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;When she gets well enough to read that, give it to
her, Max,&#8221; he said, in a low tone. &#8220;It&#8217;s something that
may surprise her a little, so I trust your discretion as
to when she is to see it. From what I hear of her, she
must be a rather level-headed, independent little girl.
And as I have something to tell her worth her knowing,
I have decided to leave the letter. Now, don&#8217;t look so
puzzled. When I come back she will likely tell you what
it means, but you may be sure it is no bad news I send
her. Will you attend to it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. But I don&#8217;t understand&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And there is no need for you to understand&mdash;just
yet. Take good care of her, and help Overton in all
possible ways to look after our interests here. There
will be a great deal to see to until Seldon or I can get
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dan is a host in himself,&#8221; said Lyster. &#8220;He
won&#8217;t want me in his way when it comes to managing
his men. But I can help Flap-Jacks carry water, or
help old Akkomi smoke, for he comes here each day for
just that purpose&mdash;that and his dinner&mdash;so never fear
but that I will make myself useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Slocum from the cabin doorway&mdash;the door was
a blanket&mdash;watched the canoe skim down the little
stream, and sighed dolefully when it disappeared entirely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Lavina,&#8221; remonstrated Mrs. Huzzard, &#8220;I do
hope that you ain&#8217;t counting on making part of the next
load that leaves here; for now that you have got here,
I&#8217;d hate the worst kind to lose you. Gold mines are
fine things to live alongside of, I dare say; but I crave
some human beings within hail&mdash;yes, indeed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly my own feelings, Cousin Lorena,&#8221; admitted
Miss Slocum, &#8220;and I regret the departure of any member
of our circle&mdash;all except the Indians. I really do not
think that any amount of living among them would
teach me to feel lonely at their absence. And that dreadful
Akkomi!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, isn&#8217;t he a trial? Not that he ever does any
harm; but he just keeps a body in mortal dread, for
fear he might take a notion to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yet Mr. Overton seems to think him entirely
friendly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Humph! yes. But if &#8217;Tana should pet a rattlesnake,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
Mr. Overton would trust it. That&#8217;s just how constant
he is to his friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now,&#8221; said Miss Lavina, with mild surprise
in her tone, &#8220;I really have seen nothing in his manner
that would indicate any extreme liking for the girl,
though she is his ward. Now, that bright young gentleman,
Mr. Lyster&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tut, tut, Lavina! Max Lyster is all eyes and hands
for her just now. He will fan her and laugh with her;
but it will be Dan who digs for her and takes the weight
of her care on his shoulders, even if he never says a word
about it. That is just Dan Overton&#8217;s way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a very fine way it is, Lorena,&#8221; said Miss Slocum,
while her eyes wandered out to where he stood talking
to Lyster. &#8220;I&#8217;ve met many men of fine manners in my
time, but I never was more impressed at first sight by
any person than by him when he conducted me personally
to you on my arrival. The man had never heard my
name before, yet he received me as if this camp had been
arranged on purpose for my visit, and that he himself
had been expecting me. If that did not contain the very
essence of fine manners, I never saw any, Lorena Jane.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I s&#8217;pose it does, Lavina,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Huzzard;
&#8220;though I never heard any one go on much about his
manners before. And as for me&mdash;well,&#8221; and she looked
a bit embarrassed, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t the best judge myself. I&#8217;ve
had such a terrible hard tussle to make a living since
my man died, that I hain&#8217;t had time to study fine manners.
I&#8217;ll have time enough before long, I suppose, for
Dan Overton surely has offered me liberal living wages.
But, Lavina, even if I did want to learn now, I wouldn&#8217;t
know where to commence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Lorena, since you mention it, there is lots of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
room for improvement in your general manner. You&#8217;ve
been with careless people, I suppose, and bad habits are
gathered that way. Now I never was much of a genius&mdash;couldn&#8217;t
trim a bonnet like you to save my life; but
I did have a most particular mother; and she held that
good manners was a recommendation in any land. So,
even if her children had no fortune left them, they were
taught to show they had careful bringing up. One of
my ideas in coming out here was that I might teach
deportment in some Indian school, but not much of that
notion is left me. Could I ever teach Flap-Jacks to quit
scratching her head in the presence of ladies and gentlemen?
No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; said Mrs. Huzzard, in a meditative
way, &#8220;that I mind the scratching so much as I do the
dratted habit she has of carrying the dish-cloth under
her arm when she don&#8217;t happen to be using it. That just
wears on my nerves, it does. But I tell you what it is,
Lavina&mdash;if you are kind of disappointed on account of
not getting Indian scholars that suit just yet, I&#8217;m more
than half willing you should teach me the deportment,
if you&#8217;d be satisfied with one big white scholar instead
of a lot of little red ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, and glad to do it,&#8221; said Miss Slocum,
frankly. &#8220;Your heart is all right, Lorena Jane; but a
warm heart will not make people forget that you lean
your elbow on the table and put your food into your
mouth with your knife. Such things jar on other people
just as Flap-Jacks and the dish-cloth jar on you. Don&#8217;t
you understand? But your desire to improve shows that
you are a very remarkable woman, Lorena, for very few
people are willing to learn new habits after having followed
careless ones for forty years.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Thirty-nine,&#8221; corrected Lorena Jane, showing that,
however peculiar and remarkable her wisdom might be
in some directions, it did not prevent a natural womanly
feeling regarding the number of years she had lived.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she continued, after a little, as Miss Lavina
kept a discreet silence, &#8220;this here gold fever is catching;
and if any one gets started on the right track, there is
no telling what day he may stumble over a fortune. One
might come my way&mdash;or yours, Lavina. And, just as
you say, fine manners is a heap of help in sassiety. And
thinking of it that way makes me feel I&#8217;d like to be prepared
to enjoy, in first-class style, any amount of money
I might get a chance at up here. For I tell you what
it is, Lavina, this Western land is a woman&#8217;s country.
Her chances in most things are always as good, and
mostly better than a man&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if she does not die from fright at the creepy looks
of the friendly Indians,&#8221; said Miss Slocum, with a
shivering breath. &#8220;I have not slept sound for a single
minute since I saw that old smoking wretch who never
seems a rod from this cabin. Now down there at Sinna
Ferry I thought it might be kind of nice, though we
stopped only a little while, and I was not up in the street.
Any real genteel people there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;yes, there is,&#8221; answered Lorena Jane, after
a slight hesitation as to just how much it would be wise to
say of the genteel gentleman who resided in Sinna Ferry,
and was in her eyes a model of culture and disdainful
superiority. Indeed, that disdain of his had been a first
cause in her desire to reach the state of polish he himself
enjoyed&mdash;to rise above the vulgar level of manners
that had of old seemed good enough to her. &#8220;Yes, there
is some high-toned folks there; the doctor&#8217;s wife and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
family, for one; and then there is a very genteel man
there&mdash;Captain Leek. He is an ex-officer in the late
war, you know; a real military gentleman, with a wound
in his leg. Limps some, but not enough to make him
awkward. He keeps the postoffice. But if this Government
looked after its heroes as it ought to, he&#8217;d be
getting a good pension&mdash;that&#8217;s just what he would. I&#8217;m
too sound a Union woman not to feel riled at times
when I see the defenders of the Constitution go unrewarded.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say &#8217;riled,&#8217; Lorena,&#8221; corrected Miss Slocum.
&#8220;You must drop that and &#8217;dratted&#8217; and &#8216;I&#8217;ll swan&#8217;; for
I don&#8217;t think you could tell what any of them mean.
I couldn&#8217;t, I&#8217;m sure. But I used to know a family of
Leeks back in Ohio. They were Democrats, though,
and their boys joined the Confederate Army, though I
heard they wasn&#8217;t much good to the cause. But of
course it is not likely to be one of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think not,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Huzzard, stoutly.
&#8220;I never heard him talk politics much; but I do know
that he wears nothing but the Union blue to this day,
and always that military sort of hat with a cord around
it&mdash;so&mdash;so dignified like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I did not suppose it could be the one I knew,&#8221;
said her cousin; &#8220;the military uniform decides that.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<h3>AWAKENING.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Flap-Jacks,&#8221; said &#8217;Tana, softly, so as to reach no
ear but that of the squaw, who came in from Harris&#8217;
cabin to find the parasol of Miss Slocum, who was about
to walk in the sunshine. To the red creature of the
forest this parasol seemed the most wonderfully beautiful
thing of all the strange things which the white
squaws made use of. &#8220;Flap-Jacks, are they gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Three weeks had gone by, three weeks of miraculous
changes in the beauty of their wild nook along the trail
of the old river.</p>
<p>&#8220;Twin Springs,&#8221; the place was called now&mdash;Twin
Spring Mines. Already men were at work on the new
lode, and doing placer digging for the free gold in the
soil. Wooden rails were laid to the edge of the stream,
and over it the small, rude car was pushed with the new
ore down to a raft on which a test load had been drifted
to the immense crusher at the works on Lake Kootenai.
And the test had resulted so favorably that the new
strike at Twin Springs was considered by far the richest
one of the year.</p>
<p>Through all the turbulence that swept up the little
stream to their camp, two of the discovering party were
housed, sick and silent, in the little double cabin. The
doctor could see no reason why &#8217;Tana was so slow in
her recovery; he had expected so much more of her&mdash;that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
she would be carried into health again by the very
force of her ambition, and her eager delight in the prospects
which her newly acquired wealth was opening up
to her.</p>
<p>But puzzling to relate, she showed no eagerness at all
about it. Her ambitions, if she had any, were asleep,
and she scarcely asked a question concerning all the
changes of life and people around her. Listless she lay
from one day to another, accepting the attention of people
indifferently. Max would read to her a good deal,
and several times she asked to be carried into the cabin
of Harris, where she would sit for hours talking to him,
sometimes in a low voice and then again sitting close
beside him in long silences, which, strangely enough,
seemed more of companionship to her than the presence
of people who laughed and talked. They wearied her
at times. When she was able to walk out, she liked to
go alone; even Max she had sent back when he followed
her.</p>
<p>But she never went far. Sometimes she would sit
for an hour by the stream, watching the water slip past
the pebbles and the grasses, and on to its turbulent journey
toward a far-off rest in the Pacific. And again, she
would watch some strange miner dig and wash the soil
in his search for the precious &#8220;yellow.&#8221; But her walks
were ever within the limits of the busy diggings; all
her old fondness for the wild places seemed sleeping&mdash;like
her ambitions.</p>
<p>&#8220;She needs change now. Get her away from here,&#8221;
advised the doctor, who no longer felt that she needed
medicines, but who could not, with all his skill, build
her up again into the daring, saucy &#8217;Tana, who had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
won the game of cards from the captain that night at
the select party at Sinna Ferry.</p>
<p>But when Overton, after much hesitation, broached
the subject of her going away, she did look at him with
a touch of the old defiance in her face, and after a bit
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess the camp will have to be big enough for
you and me, too, a few days longer. I haven&#8217;t made up
my mind as to when I want to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the summer will not last long, now. You must
commence to think of where you want to go; for when
the cold weather comes, &#8217;Tana, you can&#8217;t remain here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can if I want to,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>After one troubled, helpless look at her pale face,
he walked out of the cabin; and Lyster, who had wanted
to ask the result of the interview, could not find him
all that evening. He had gone somewhere alone, up on
the mountain.</p>
<p>She had answered him with a great deal of cool indifference;
but when the two cousins entered her room,
she was on the bed with her face buried in the pillows,
weeping in an uncontrollable manner that filled them
with dismay. The doctor decided that while Dan was
a good fellow in most ways, he evidently had not a soothing
influence on &#8217;Tana, possibly not realizing the changed
mental condition laid on her by her sickness. The doctor
further made up his mind that, without hurting Dan&#8217;s
feelings, he must find some other mouthpiece for his
ideas concerning her or reason with her himself.</p>
<p>But, so far, she would only say she was not ready to
go yet. Dan, wishing to make her stay comfortable as
possible, went quietly to all the settlements within reach
for luxuries in the way of house-furnishing, and had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
Mrs. Huzzard use them in &#8217;Tana&#8217;s cabin. But when he
had done all this, she never asked a question as to
where the comforts came from&mdash;she, who, a short month
before, had valued each kind glance received from him.</p>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard was sorely afraid that it was pride, the
pride of newly acquired wealth, that changed her from
the gay, saucy girl into a moody, dreamy being, who
would lie all alone for hours and not notice any of
them coming and going. The good soul had many a
heartache over it all, never guessing that it was an
ache and a shame in the heart of the girl that made the
new life that was given her seem a thing of little value.</p>
<p>&#8217;Tana had watched the squaw wistfully at times, as
if expecting her to say something to her when the others
were not around, but she never did. When &#8217;Tana heard
the ladies ask Lyster to go with them to a certain place
where beautiful mosses were to be found, she waited with
impatience until their voices left the door.</p>
<p>The squaw shook her head when asked in that whispering
way of their departure; but when she had carried out
the parasol and watched the party disappear beyond the
numerous tents now dotting the spaces where the grass
grew rank only a month before, then she slipped back
and stood watchful and silent inside the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come close,&#8221; said the girl, motioning with a certain
nervousness to her. She was not the brave, indifferent
little girl she had been of old. &#8220;Come close&mdash;some one
might listen, somewhere. I&#8217;ve been so sick&mdash;I&#8217;ve dreamed
so many things that I can&#8217;t tell some days what is dream
and what is true. I lie here and think and think, but it
will not come clear. Listen! I think sometimes you
and I hunted for tracks&mdash;a white man&#8217;s tracks&mdash;across
there where the high ferns are. You showed them to me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
and then we came back when the moon shone, and it
was light like day, and I picked white flowers. Some
days I think of it&mdash;of the tracks, long, slim tracks, with
the boot heel. Then my head hurts, and I think maybe
we never found the tracks, maybe it is only a dream, like&mdash;like
other things!&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not ask if it were so, but she leaned forward
with all of eager question in her eyes. It was the first
time she had shown strong interest in anything. But,
having aroused from her listlessness to speak of the
ghosts of fancy haunting her, she seemed quickened to
anxiety by the picture her own words conjured up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! those tracks in the black mud and that face
above the ledge!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; said the squaw, &#8220;and not a dream. The
track of the white man was there, and the moon was in
the sky, as you say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah!&#8221; and the evidently unwelcome truth made her
clench her fingers together despairingly; she had hoped
so that it was a dream. The truth of it banished her
lethargy, made her think as nothing else had. &#8220;Ah! it
was so, then; and the face&mdash;the face was real, was&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I saw no face,&#8221; said the squaw.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I did&mdash;yes, I did,&#8221; she muttered. &#8220;I saw it like
the face of a white devil!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she checked herself and glanced at the Indian
woman, whose dark, heavy face appeared so stupid.
Still, one never could tell by the looks of an Indian how
much or how little he knows of the thing you want to
know; and after a moment&#8217;s scrutiny, the girl asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you learn more of the tracks?&mdash;learn who the
white man was that made them?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You sick&mdash;much sick,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;All time
Dan he say: &#8216;Stay here by white girl&#8217;s bed. Never
leave.&#8217; So I not get out again, and the rain come wash
all track away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Dan know?&mdash;did you tell him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Dan never ask&mdash;never talk to me, only say, &#8216;Take
care &#8217;Tana,&#8217; that all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl asked no more, but lay there on her couch,
filled with dry moss and covered with skins of the mountain
wolf. Her eyes closed as though she were asleep;
but the squaw knew better, and after a little, she said
doubtfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe Akkomi know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Akkomi!&#8221; and the eyes opened wide and slant. &#8220;That
is so. I should have remembered. But oh, all the
thoughts in my brain have been so muddled. You have
heard something, then? Tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much&mdash;only little,&#8221; answered the squaw. &#8220;That
night&mdash;late that night, a white stranger reached Akkomi&#8217;s
tent, to sleep. No one else of the tribe got to see him,
so the word is. Kawaka heard on the river, and it was
that night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then? Where did the stranger go?&#8221;</p>
<p>The squaw shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me not know. Kawaka not hear. But I thought
of the track. Now many white men make tracks, and one
no matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Akkomi,&#8221; and the thoughts of the girl went back
to the very first she could remember of her recovery;
and always, each day, the face of Akkomi had been near
her. He had not talked, but would look at her a little
while with his sharp, bead-like eyes, and then betake
himself to the sunshine outside her door, where he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
smoke placidly for hours and watch the restless Anglo-Saxon
in his struggle to make the earth yield up its
riches.</p>
<p>Each day Akkomi had been there, and she had not
once aroused herself to question why; but she would.</p>
<p>Rising, she passed out and looked right and left; but
no blanketed brave met her gaze. Only Kawaka, the
husband of Flap-Jacks, worked about the canoes by the
water. Then she entered Harris&#8217; cabin, where the sight
of his helpless form, and his welcoming smile, made
her halt, and drop down on the rug beside him. She
had forgotten him so much of late, and she touched his
hand remorsefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as if I had just got awake, Joe,&#8221; she said, and
stretched out her arms, as though to drive away the
last vestige of sleep. &#8220;Do you know how that feels?
To lie for days, stupid as a chilled snake, and then, all
at once, to feel the sun creeping around where you are
and warming you until you begin to wonder how you
could have slept so many days away. Well, just now I
feel almost well again. I did not think I would get well;
I did not care. All the days I lay in there I wished
they would just let me be, and throw their medicines
in the creek. I think, Joe, that there are times when
people should be allowed to die, when they grow tired&mdash;tired
away down in their hearts; so tired that they don&#8217;t
want to take up the old tussle of living again. It is so
much easier to die then than when a person is happy, and&mdash;and
has some one to like them, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She left the sentence unfinished, but he nodded a perfect
understanding of her thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you have felt like that, too, I suppose,&#8221; she
continued, after a little. &#8220;But now, Joe, they tell me we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
are rich&mdash;you and Dan and I&mdash;so rich we ought to be
happy, all of us. Are we?&#8221;</p>
<p>He only smiled at her, and glanced at the cozy furnishing
of his rude cabin. Like &#8217;Tana&#8217;s, it had been
given a complete going over by Overton, and rugs and
robes did much to soften its crude wood-work. It had
all the luxury obtainable in that district, though even yet
the doors were but heavy skins.</p>
<p>She noticed the look but shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thick rugs and soft pillows don&#8217;t make troubles
lighter,&#8221; she said, with conviction; and then: &#8220;Maybe
Dan is happy. He&mdash;he must be. All he thinks of now
is the gold ore.&#8221;</p>
<p>She spoke so wistfully, and her own eyes looked so
far, far from happy, that the face of the man was filled
with longing to comfort her&mdash;the little girl who had
tramped so long on a lone trail&mdash;how lonely none knew
so well as he. His fingers closed and unclosed, as if
with the desire to clasp her hand,&mdash;to make some visible
show of friendship.</p>
<p>She saw the slight movement, and looked up at him
with a new interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I forgot, Joe! I never once have asked how you
have got along while I have been so sick. Can you use
your hands any at all? You could once, a little bit that
day&mdash;the day we found the gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he shook his head, and just then a step was heard
outside, and Lyster looked in.</p>
<p>A shade of surprise touched his face, as he saw &#8217;Tana
there, with so bright an expression in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;What has Harris been telling you that has aroused
you to interest, Tana?&#8221; he asked, jestingly. &#8220;He has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
more influence than I, for I have scarcely been able to
get you to talk at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need me; you have Miss Slocum,&#8221; she
answered. &#8220;Have you dropped her in the creek and
run back to camp? And have you seen Akkomi lately?
I want him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you do. The moment I make my appearance,
you want to get rid of me by sending me for
some other man. No, I am happy to say I have not seen
that royal loafer for the past hour. And I am more
happy still to find that you really want some one&mdash;any
one&mdash;once more. Do you realize, my dear girl, how very
many days it is since you have condescended to want
anything on this earth of ours? Won&#8217;t you accept me
as a substitute for Akkomi?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you.&#8221;</p>
<p>But her eyes smiled on him kindly, and he did not
believe her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not; but won&#8217;t you pretend you do for a
little while, long enough to come with me for a little
walk&mdash;or else to talk to me in your cabin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To talk to you? I don&#8217;t think I can talk much to
any one yet. I just told Joe I feel as if I was only waking
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I see; that is the reason I am asking an audience.
I will do the talking, and it need not be a very
long talk, if you are too tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I will go,&#8221; she said, at last. &#8220;I was thinking
it would be nice to float in a canoe again&mdash;just to
float lazy on the current. Can&#8217;t we do that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing easier,&#8221; he answered, entirely delighted that
she was again more like the &#8217;Tana of two months before.
She seemed to him a little paler and a little taller, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
as they walked together to the canoe, he felt that they
would again come to the old chummy days of Sinna
Ferry, when they quarreled and made up as regularly as
the sun rose and set.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you talk?&#8221; she asked, as their little
craft drifted away from the tents and the man who
washed the soil by the spring run. &#8220;What did you do
with the women folks?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gave them to Overton. They concluded not to risk
their precious selves with me, when they discovered that
he, for a wonder, was disengaged. Really and truly, that
angular schoolmistress will make herself Mrs. Overton
if he is not careful. She flatters him enough to spoil
an average man; looks at him with so much respectful
awe, you know, though she never does say much to
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Saves her breath to drill Mrs. Huzzard with,&#8221; observed
the girl, dryly. &#8220;That poor, dear woman has a
bee in her muddled old head, and the bee is Captain
Leek and his fine manners. I can see it, plain as day.
Bless her heart! I hear her go over and over words
that she always used to say wrong, and she does
eat nicer than she used to. Humph! I wonder if Dan
Overton will take as kindly to being taught, when the
school-teacher begins with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a mirthless, unlovely smile about her lips,
and Lyster reached over and clasped her hand coaxingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana, what has changed you so?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Is it
your sickness&mdash;is it the gold&mdash;or what, that makes you
turn from your old friends? Dan never says a word,
but I notice it. You never talk to him, and he has
almost quit going to your cabin at all, though he would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
do anything for you, I know. My dear, you will find
few friends like him in the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t&mdash;don&#8217;t bother me about him,&#8221; she answered,
irritably. &#8220;He is all right, of course. But I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she stopped, and with a determined air turned
the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said you had something to talk to me about.
What was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t know how glad I am to hear you speak
as you used to,&#8221; he said, looking at her kindly. &#8220;I
would be rejoiced even to get a scolding from you these
days. But that was not exactly what I brought you
out to tell you, either,&#8221; and he drew from his pocket
the letter he had carried for three weeks, waiting until
she appeared strong enough to accept surprises. &#8220;I
suppose, of course, you have heard us talk a good deal
about the Eastern capitalist who was here when you
were so sick, and who, unhesitatingly, made purchase
of the Twin Spring Mines, as it is called now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the very fine Mr. Haydon, who had curly
hair and looked like me?&#8221; she asked, ironically. &#8220;Yes,
I&#8217;ve heard the women folks talking about him a good
deal, when they thought me asleep. Old Akkomi scared
him a little, too, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So, you <i>have</i> heard?&#8221; he asked, in surprise. &#8220;Well,
yes, he does look a little like you; it&#8217;s the hair, I think.
But I don&#8217;t see why you utter his name with so much
contempt, &#8217;Tana.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not; but I&#8217;ve heard the name of Haydon before
to-day, and I have a grudge against it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not this Haydon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know which Haydon. I never saw any of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
them&mdash;don&#8217;t know as I want to. I guess this one is
almost too fine for Kootenai country people, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is where you are wrong, entirely wrong,
&#8217;Tana,&#8221; he hastened to explain. &#8220;He was very much
interested in you&mdash;very much, indeed; asked lots of
questions about you, and&mdash;and here is what I wanted
to speak of. When he went away, he gave me this
letter for you. I imagine he wants to help make arrangements
for you when you go East, have you know
nice people and all that. You see, &#8217;Tana, his daughter
is about your age, and looks just a little as you do sometimes;
and I think he wants to do something for you. It&#8217;s
an odd thing for him to take so strong an interest in any
stranger; but they are the very best people you could
possibly know if you go to Philadelphia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe if you would let me see the letter myself, I
could tell better whether I wanted to know them or
not,&#8221; she said, and Lyster handed it to her without
another word.</p>
<p>It was a rather long letter, two closely-written sheets,
and he could not understand the little contemptuous
smile with which she opened it. Haydon, the great
financier, had seemed to him a very wonderful personage
when he was &#8217;Tana&#8217;s age.</p>
<p>The girl was not so indifferent as she tried to appear.
Her fingers trembled a little, though her mouth grew
set and angry as she read the carefully kind words
of Mr. Haydon.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is rather late in the day for them to come with
offers to help me,&#8221; she said, bitterly. &#8220;I can help myself
now; but if they had looked for me a year ago&mdash;two or
three years ago&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looked for you!&#8221; he exclaimed, with a sort of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
impatient wonder. &#8220;Why, my dear girl, who would even
think of hunting for little white girls in these forests?
Don&#8217;t be foolishly resentful now that people want to be
nice to you. You could not expect attention from people
before they were aware of your existence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they did know of my existence!&#8221; she answered,
curtly. &#8220;Oh! you needn&#8217;t stare at me like that, Mr.
Max Lyster! I know what I&#8217;m talking about. I have
the very shaky honor of being a relation of your fine
gentleman from the East. I thought it when I heard
the name, but did not suppose he would know it. And
I&#8217;m not too proud of it, either, as you seem to think I
ought to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they are one of our best families&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then your worst must be pretty bad,&#8221; she interrupted.
&#8220;I know just about what they are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But &#8217;Tana&mdash;how does it come&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t answer any questions about it, Max, so don&#8217;t
ask,&#8221; and she folded up the letter and tore it into very
little pieces, which she let fall into the water. &#8220;I am
not going to claim the relationship or their hospitality,
and I would just as soon you forgot that I acknowledged
it. I didn&#8217;t mean to tell, but that letter vexed me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, &#8217;Tana,&#8221; and Lyster caught her hand
again. &#8220;I can&#8217;t let you act like this. They can be of
much more help to you socially than all your money. If
the family are related to you, and offer you attention,
you can&#8217;t afford to ignore it. You do not realize now how
much their attention will mean; but when you are older,
you will regret losing it. Let me advise you&mdash;let me&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, hush!&#8221; she said, closing her eyes, wearily. &#8220;I
am tired&mdash;tired! What difference does it make to you&mdash;why
need you care?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;May I tell you?&#8221; and he looked at her so strangely,
so gravely, that her eyes opened in expectation of&mdash;she
knew not what.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not mean to let you know so soon, &#8217;Tana,&#8221;
and his clasp of her hand grew closer; &#8220;but, it is true&mdash;I
love you. Everything that concerns you makes a difference
to me. Now do you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You!&mdash;Max&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t draw your hand away. Surely you guessed&mdash;a
little? I did not know myself how much I cared
till you came so near dying. Then I knew I could not
bear to let you go. And&mdash;and you care a little too, don&#8217;t
you! Speak to me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go home,&#8221; she answered in a low voice, and
tried to draw her fingers away. She liked him&mdash;yes;
but&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tana, won&#8217;t you speak? Oh, my dear, dear one, when
you were so ill, so very ill, you knew no one else, but
you turned to me. You went asleep with your cheek
against my hand, and more than once, &#8217;Tana, with your
hand clasping mine. Surely that was enough to make
me hope&mdash;for you did like me a little, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&mdash;liked you,&#8221; but she turned her head away,
that he could not see her flushed face. &#8220;You were good
to me, but I did not know&mdash;I could not guess&mdash;&#8221; and she
broke down as though about to cry, and his own eyes
were full of tenderness. She appealed to him now as she
had never done in her days of brightness and laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; he said, pleadingly. &#8220;I won&#8217;t worry
you. I know you are too weak and ill to decide yet about
your future. I don&#8217;t ask you to answer me now. Wait.
Go to school, as I know you intend to do; but don&#8217;t forget
me. After the school is over you can decide. I will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
wait with all patience. I would not have told you now,
but I wanted you to know I was interested in the answer
you would give Haydon. I wanted you to know that I
would not for the world advise you, but for your best
interests. Won&#8217;t you believe&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you; but I don&#8217;t know what to say to you.
You are different from me&mdash;your people are different.
And of my people you know nothing, nothing at all,
and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it makes no difference,&#8221; he interrupted. &#8220;I know
you have had a lot of trouble for a little girl, or your
family have had trouble you are sensitive about. I don&#8217;t
know what it is, but it makes no difference&mdash;not a bit.
I will never question about it, unless you prefer to tell of
your own accord. Oh, my dear! if some day you could
be my wife, I would help you forget all your childish
troubles and your unpleasant life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go home,&#8221; she said, &#8220;you are good to me, but
I am so tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>He obediently turned the canoe, and at that moment
voices came to them from toward the river&mdash;ringing
voices of men.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is possibly Mr. Haydon and others,&#8221; he exclaimed,
after listening a moment. &#8220;We have been expecting
them for days. That was why I could no longer put off
giving you the letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she said, and her face flushed and paled a
little, as the voices came closer. He could see she nervously
dreaded the meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I get the canoe back to camp before they come?&#8221;
he asked kindly; but she shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t, for they move fast,&#8221; she answered, as she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
listened. &#8220;They would see us; and, if he is with them,
he&mdash;would think I was afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>He let the canoe drift again, and watched her moody
face, which seemed to grow more cold with each moment
that the strangers came closer. He was filled with surprise
at all she had said of Haydon and of the letter.
Who would have dreamed that she&mdash;the little Indian-dressed
guest of Akkomi&#8217;s camp&mdash;would be connected
with the most exclusive family he knew in the East?
The Haydon family was one he had been especially interested
in only a year ago, because of Mr. Haydon&#8217;s
very charming daughter. Miss Haydon, however, had
a clever and ambitious mamma, who persisted in keeping
him at a safe distance.</p>
<p>Max Lyster, with his handsome face and unsettled
prospects, was not the brilliant match her hopes aspired
to. Pretty Margaret Haydon had, in all obedience, refused
him dances and affected not to see his efforts to be
near her. But he knew she did see; and one little bit of
comfort he had taken West with him was the fancy
that her refusals were never voluntary affairs, and that
she had looked at him as he had never known her to
look at another man.</p>
<p>Well, that was a year ago, and he had just asked another
girl to marry him&mdash;a girl who did not look at him
at all, but whose eyes were on the swift-flowing current&mdash;troubled
eyes, that made him long to take care of her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you speak to me at all?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;I will
do anything to help you, &#8217;Tana&mdash;anything at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded her head slowly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;now,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;So would Mr. Haydon,
Max.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana! do you mean&mdash;&#8221; His face flushed hotly, and
he looked at her for the first time with anger in his face.</p>
<p>She put out her hand in a tired, pleading way.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only mean that now, when I have been lucky enough
to help myself, it seems as if every one thinks I need
looking after so much more than they used to. Maybe
because I am not strong yet&mdash;maybe so; I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;
Then she smiled and looked at him curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I made a mistake when I said &#8217;every one,&#8217; didn&#8217;t
I? For Dan never comes near me any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the strange canoes came in sight and very close
to them, as they turned a bend in the creek. There were
three large boats&mdash;one carrying freight, one filled with
new men for the works, and in the other&mdash;the foremost
one&mdash;was Mr. Haydon, and a tall, thin, middle-aged
stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Seldon!&#8221; exclaimed Lyster, with animation,
and held the canoe still in the water, that the other might
come close, and in a whisper he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The one to the right is Mr. Haydon.&#8221;</p>
<p>He glanced at her and saw she was making a painful
effort at self-control.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;We will just speak,
and drift on past them.&#8221;</p>
<p>But when they called greeting to each other, and the
Indian boatman was told to send their craft close to the
little camp canoe, she raised her head and looked very
levelly across the stranger, who had hair so like her own,
and spoke to the Indian who paddled their boat as though
he were the only one there to notice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Plucky!&#8221; decided Mr. Haydon, &#8220;and stubborn;&#8221; but
he kept those thoughts to himself, and said aloud: &#8220;My
dear young lady, I am indeed pleased to see you so far
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
recovered since my last visit. I presume you know who
I am,&#8221; and he looked at her in a smiling, confidential
way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know who you are. Your name is Haydon,
and&mdash;there is a piece of your letter.&#8221;</p>
<p>She picked up a fragment of paper that had fallen
at her feet, and flung it out from her on the water. Mr.
Haydon affected not to see the pettish act, but turned
to his companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you allow me, Miss Rivers, to introduce another
member of our firm? This is Mr. Seldon. Seldon, this
is the young girl I told you of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it before you spoke,&#8221; said the other man,
who looked at her with a great deal of interest, and a
great deal of kindness. &#8220;My child, I was your mother&#8217;s
friend long ago. Won&#8217;t you let me be yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>She reached out her hand to him, and the quick tears
came to her eyes. She trusted without question the
earnest gray eyes of the speaker, and turned from her
own uncle to the uncle of Max.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>
<h3>THE MAN IN AKKOMI&#8217;S CLOAK.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;My dear fellow, there is, of course, no way of thanking
you sufficiently for your care of her; but I can only
say I am mighty glad to know a man like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Mr. Seldon who said so, and Dan Overton
looked embarrassed and deprecating under the praise
he had to accept.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is all right for you to make a fuss over it, Seldon,&#8221;
he returned; &#8220;but you know, as well as you know dinner
time, that you would have done no less if you had found
a young girl anywhere without a home&mdash;and especially
if you found her in an Indian camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did she give you any information as to how she came
to be there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton looked at him good-naturedly, but shook his
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t give you any information about that,&#8221; he
answered. &#8220;If you want to know anything of her previous
to meeting her here, she will have to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But she won&#8217;t. I can&#8217;t understand it; for I can see
no need of mystery. I knew her mother when she was
a girl like &#8217;Tana, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did. So now, perhaps, you will understand
why I take such an interest in her&mdash;why Mr. Haydon
takes an interest in her. Simply because she is his niece.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she is&mdash;is she? And he came here, found her
dying, or next door to it, and never claimed her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No; that is a little way of his,&#8221; acknowledged his
partner. &#8220;If she had really died, he never would have
said a word about it, for it would have caused him
a lot of troublesome explanation at home. But I guess
he knew I would be likely to come across her. She is
the very image of what her mother was. He told me the
whole story of how he found her here, and all. And
now he wants to do the proper thing and take her home
with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The devil he does!&#8221; growled Overton. &#8220;Well, why do
you come to me about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your influence with her was one thing,&#8221; answered
Mr. Seldon, with a dubious smile at the dark face before
him. &#8220;This <i>protégée</i> of yours has a will of her
own, it seems, and refuses utterly to acknowledge her
aristocratic relations, refuses to be a part of her uncle&#8217;s
household; and we want your influence toward changing
her mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ll never get it,&#8221; and the tone was decided
as the words. &#8220;If she says she is no relation to anybody,
I&#8217;ll back her up in it, and not ask her her reasons, either.
If she doesn&#8217;t want to go with Mr. Haydon, she is
the only one I will allow to decide, unless he brings a
legal order from some court, and I might try to hinder
him even then. She willingly came under my guardianship,
and when she leaves it, it must be willingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course there will be no coercion about the
matter,&#8221; explained Mr. Seldon, hastily. &#8220;But don&#8217;t you,
yourself, think it would be a decided advantage for her
to live for a while with her own relatives?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am in no position to judge. I don&#8217;t know her relatives.
I don&#8217;t know why it is that she has not been taken
care of by them long ago; and I am not asking any questions.
She knows, and that is enough; and I am sure
her reasons for not going would satisfy me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are a fine specimen to come to for influence,&#8221;
observed the other. &#8220;She has a grudge against
Haydon, that is the obstacle&mdash;a grudge, because he quarreled
with her mother long ago. I thought that as you
have done so much for her, your word might have weight
in showing her the folly of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My word would have no more weight than yours,&#8221;
he answered, curtly. &#8220;All I have done for her amounts
to nothing; and I&#8217;ve an idea that if she wanted me to
know her family affairs, she would tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which, interpreted, means that I had better be at
other business than gossiping,&#8221; said Mr. Seldon, with
much good humor. &#8220;Well, you are a fine pair, and something
alike, too&mdash;you goldfinders! She snubbed Max for
trying to persuade her, and you snub me. As a last resort,
I think I shall try to get that old Indian into our
lobbying here. He is her next great friend, I hear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen him in camp to-day, for a wonder;
but he is sure to be around before night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, you see, we are to go on up to the new works
on the lake to-day, and be back day after to-morrow. I
wish you, too, could go up to-morrow, for I would like
your judgment about some changes we expect to make.
Could you leave here for twenty-four hours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; promised Overton. &#8220;But the new men from
the Ferry will be up to-day or to-morrow, so I may not
reach there until you are about ready to start back.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come anyway, if you can, I don&#8217;t seem to get much
chance to talk to you here in camp&mdash;maybe I could on the
river. You may be in a more reasonable mood about
&#8217;Tana by that time, and try to influence her to partake
of civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Civilization!&#8217; Oh, yes, of course, you imagine it all
lies east of the Appalachian range,&#8221; remarked Overton,
slightingly. &#8220;I expect that from a man of Haydon&#8217;s
stamp, but not from you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seldon only laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;One would think you had been born and bred out
here in the West,&#8221; he remarked, &#8220;while you are really
only an importation. But what is that racket about?&#8221;</p>
<p>For screeches were sounding from the cabin&mdash;cries,
feminine and frightened.</p>
<p>Overton and Seldon started for it, as did several of
the workmen, but their haste slackened as they saw &#8217;Tana
leaning against a doorway and laughing, while the squaw
stood near her, chuckling a little as a substitute for merriment.</p>
<p>But there were two others within the cabin who were
by no means merry&mdash;the two cousins, who were standing
huddled together on the couch, uttering spasmodic
screeches at every movement made by a little gray snake
on the floor.</p>
<p>It had crept in at a crevice, and did not know how to
make its escape from the noisy shelter it had found. Its
fright was equal to that of the women, for it appeared
decidedly restless, and each uneasy movement of it was
a signal for fresh screams.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Overton! I beg of you, kill the horrible reptile!&#8221;
moaned Miss Slocum, who at that moment was as
indifferent to the proprieties as Mrs. Huzzard, and was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
displaying considerable white hosiery and black gaiter
tops.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, lawsy! It is coming this way again. Ooh&mdash;ooh&mdash;h!&#8221;
and Mrs. Huzzard did a little dance from one
foot to the other, in a very ecstasy of fear. &#8220;Oh, Lavina,
I&#8217;ll never forgive myself for advising you to come out
to this Idaho country! Oh, Lord! won&#8217;t somebody
kill it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, there is no need to fear that little thing,&#8221; said
Overton. &#8220;Really, it is not a snake to bite&mdash;no more
harm in it than in a mouse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A <i>mouse</i>!&#8221; they both shrieked. &#8220;Oh, please take it
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then Akkomi came in through the other cabin,
and, hearing the shrieks, simply stooped and picked up
the little stranger in his hand, holding it that they might
see how harmless it was.</p>
<p>But, instead of pacifying them, as he had kindly intended,
they only cowered against the wall, too horrified
even to scream, while they gazed at the old Indian, as
at something just from the infernal regions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, have mercy on our souls,&#8221; muttered Lavina,
in a sepulchral tone, and with pallid, almost moveless,
lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forever and ever, amen,&#8221; added Lorena Jane, clutching
her drapery a little closer, and a little higher.</p>
<p>And not until Overton persuaded Akkomi to throw
the frightened little thing away did they consent to move
from their pedestal. Even then it was with fear and
trembling, and many an awful glance toward the placid
old Indian, who smoked his pipe and never glanced
toward them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Never again will I sleep in that room&mdash;not if I die
for it!&#8221; announced Mrs. Huzzard, and Miss Slocum was
of the same mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the cabin is as safe as a tent,&#8221; said &#8217;Tana, persuasively,
&#8220;and, really, it was not a dangerous snake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ooh&mdash;h! I beg that you will not mention it,&#8221; shivered
Miss Slocum. &#8220;For my part, I don&#8217;t expect to sleep
anywhere after this terrible experience. But I&#8217;ll go
wherever Lorena Jane goes, and do what I can to comfort
and protect her, while she rests.&#8221;</p>
<p>Akkomi sat on Harris&#8217; doorstep, and smoked, while
they argued on the dangers around them, and were satisfied
only when Overton put a tent at their disposal.
They proceeded to have hammocks swung in it on poles
set for the purpose, as they could feel safe on no bed resting
on the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, really, my conscience troubles me about leaving
you here alone, &#8217;Tana,&#8221; said Mrs. Huzzard, and Overton
also looked at her as if interested in her comfort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, your conscience had better give itself a rest, if
that is all it has to disturb it,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
care the least bit about staying alone&mdash;I rather like it;
though, if I need any one, I&#8217;ll have Flap-Jacks stay.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Overton left them to their arrangements, and said
nothing to &#8217;Tana; but as Seldon and Haydon were about
to embark, he spoke to the former.</p>
<p>&#8220;I may not be able to get up there after all, as I may
feel it necessary to be here at night, so don&#8217;t wait for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Overton; but we&#8217;d like to have you.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the others had left the cabin, Akkomi still remained,
and the girl watched him uneasily but did not
speak. She talked to Harris, telling him of the funny
actions of the two frightened women, but all the time she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
talked and tried to entertain the helpless man, it was
with an evident effort, for the dark old Indian&#8217;s face at
the door was constantly drawing her attention.</p>
<p>When she finally entered her own room, he appeared at
the entrance, and, after a careful glance, to see that no
one was near, he entered and spoke:</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana, it is now two suns since we talked. Will you
go to-day in my boat for a little ways?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, angrily. &#8220;Go home to your tepee,
Akkomi, and tell the man there I am sorry he is not dead.
I never will see him again. I go away from this place
now&mdash;very soon&mdash;maybe this week. What becomes of
him I do not care, and it will be long before I come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>He muttered some words of regret, and she turned to
him more kindly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know, Akkomi, you are my good friend. You
think it is right to do what you are doing now. Maybe
it is; maybe I am wrong. But I will not be different in
this matter&mdash;never&mdash;never!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he should come here&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would not dare. There are people here he had
better fear. Give him the names of Seldon and of Haydon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows; but it is the new miners he fears most;
they come from all parts. He wants money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him work for it, like an honest man,&#8221; she said,
curtly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t talk of it again. I will not go outside
the camp alone, and I will not listen to any more words
about it. Now mind that!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the other cabin, Harris listened intently to each
word uttered. His eyes fairly blazed in his eagerness
to hear &#8217;Tana&#8217;s final decision. But when Akkomi
slouched past his door, and peered in, with his sharp,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
quick eyes, he had relapsed again into the apathetic state
habitual to him. To all appearances he had not heard
their words, and the old Indian walked thoughtfully past
the tents and out into the timber.</p>
<p>Lyster called some light greeting to him, but he barely
looked up and made no reply whatever. His thoughts
were evidently on other things than camp sociabilities.</p>
<p>It was dark when he returned, and his fit of thoughtfulness
was yet upon him, for he spoke to no one. Overton,
who had been talking to Harris, noticed him smoking
beside the door as he came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;You had better bring your camp down here,&#8221; he remarked,
ironically. &#8220;Well, for to-night you will have
to spread your blanket in this room if Harris doesn&#8217;t
object. That is what I am to do, for I&#8217;ve given up my
quarters to the ladies, who are afraid of snakes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Akkomi nodded, and then Overton moved nearer the
door again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim, I may not be back for an hour or so. I am going
either on the water or up on the mountain for a little
while. Don&#8217;t lie awake for me, and I&#8217;ll send a fellow in
to look after you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harris nodded, and &#8217;Tana, in her own room, heard
Overton&#8217;s steps die away in the night. He was going
on the water or on the mountains&mdash;the places she loved
to go, and dared not.</p>
<p>She felt like calling after him to wait to take her with
him once more, and did rise and go to the door, but no
farther.</p>
<p>Lights were gleaming all along the little stream;
laughter and men&#8217;s voices came to her across the level.
Her own corner of the camp looked very dark and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
shadowy in comparison. But she turned back to it with
a sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;You may go, Flap-Jacks,&#8221; she said to the squaw.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind being alone, but first fix the bed of
Harris.&#8221;</p>
<p>She noticed Akkomi outside the door, but did not
speak to him. She heard the miner enter the other cabin
and assist Harris to his couch and then depart. She
wondered a little that the old Indian still sat there smoking,
instead of spreading his blanket, as Overton had
invited him to do.</p>
<p>A book of poems, presented to her by Lyster, was so
engrossing, however, that she forgot the old fellow, until
a movement at the door aroused her, and she turned to
find the silent smoker inside her cabin.</p>
<p>But it was not Akkomi, though it was the cloak of
Akkomi that fell from his shoulders.</p>
<p>It was a man dressed as an Indian, but his speech was
the speech of a white man, as he frowned on her white,
startled face.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, my fine lady, I&#8217;ve found you at last, even if you
have got too high and mighty to come when I sent for
you,&#8221; he said, growlingly. &#8220;But I&#8217;ll change your tune
very quick for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget that I can change yours,&#8221; she retorted.
&#8220;A word from me, and you know there is not a man in
this camp wouldn&#8217;t help land you where you belong&mdash;in
a prison, or at the end of a rope.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; and he grimaced in a sardonic way. &#8220;I&#8217;m
not a bit afraid of that&mdash;not a bit in the world. You
can&#8217;t afford it. These high-toned friends you&#8217;ve been
making might drop off a little if they heard your old
record.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And who made it for me?&#8221; she demanded. &#8220;You!
You&#8217;ve been a curse to every one connected with you.
In that other room is a man who might be strong and
well to-day but for you. And there is that girl buried
over there by the picture rocks of Arrow Lake. Think
of my mother, dragged to death through the slums of
&#8217;Frisco! And me&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you with a gold mine, or the price of one,&#8221; he
concluded&mdash;&#8220;plenty of money and plenty of friends. That
is about the facts of your case&mdash;friends, from millionaires
down to that digger I saw you with the other
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare say a word against him!&#8221; she exclaimed,
threateningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s the way the land lies, is it?&#8221; he asked, with
an ugly leer at her. &#8220;And that is why you were playing
&#8217;meet me by moonlight alone,&#8217; that night when I saw
you together at the spring. Well, I think your money
might help you to some one besides a married man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A married man?&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;Dan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan, it is,&#8221; he answered, insolently. &#8220;But you
needn&#8217;t faint away on that account. I have other use
for you&mdash;I want some money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are telling that lie about him because you think
it will trouble me,&#8221; she said, regarding his painted face
closely and giving no heed to his demand. &#8220;You know
it is not true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About the marriage? I&#8217;ll swear&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not believe your oath for anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you wouldn&#8217;t? Well, now, what if I prove to
you, right in this camp, that I know his wife?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His wife?&#8221; She sat down on the side of the couch,
and all the cabin seemed whirling around her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;a girl he married. You may call her what
you please. She had been called a good many things before
he picked her up. Humph! Now that he has
struck it rich, some one ought to let her know. She&#8217;d
make the dollars fly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not true! It is not <i>true</i>!&#8221; she murmured to herself,
as if by the words she could drive away the possibility
of it.</p>
<p>He appeared to enjoy the sensation he had created.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; he answered&mdash;&#8220;every word of it, and he
has been keeping quiet about it, has he? Well, see here.
You don&#8217;t believe me&mdash;do you? Now, while I was waiting
there at the door, a man came in to put your paralyzed
partner to bed. The man was Jake Emmons&mdash;used
to hang out at Spokane. He knew Lottie Snyder
before this Overton did&mdash;and after Overton married her,
too, I guess. You ask him anything you want to know
of it. He can tell you&mdash;if he will.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer. She feared, as he talked, that
it was true; and she longed for him to go away, that
she could think alone. The hot blood burned in her
cheeks, as she remembered that night by the Twin
Springs. The humiliation of it, if it proved true!</p>
<p>&#8220;But, see here, &#8217;Tana. I didn&#8217;t come here to talk
about your virtuous ranger. I want some money&mdash;enough
to cut the country. It ain&#8217;t any more than fair,
anyway, that you divide with me, for if it hadn&#8217;t been
for that sneaking hound in the other room, half of this
find would have been mine a year ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will do more good where it is,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;He did right not to trust you. And if he were able
to walk, you would not be allowed to live many minutes
within reach of him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes; I know he was trailing me,&#8221; he answered,
indifferently, &#8220;but it was no hard trick to keep out of
his road. I suppose you let him know you approve of
his feelings toward me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I would load a gun for him to use on you if he
were able to hold it,&#8221; she answered, and he seemed to
think her words amusing.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have mighty little regard for your duty to me,&#8221;
he observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Duty? I can&#8217;t owe you any duty when I never received
any from you. I am nearly seventeen, and in all
the years I remember you, I can&#8217;t recall any good act
you have ever done for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly seventeen,&#8221; and he smiled at her in the way
she hated. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t your new uncle, Haydon, tell you
better than that? You are nearly eighteen years old.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eighteen!&#8221; and she rose in astonishment. &#8220;I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;though you don&#8217;t look it. You always were
small for your age, so I just told you a white lie about it
in order to manage you better. But that is over; I don&#8217;t
care what you do in the future. All I want of you is
money to get to South America; so fix it up for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ought to refuse, and call them in to arrest you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you won&#8217;t,&#8221; he rejoined. &#8220;You can&#8217;t afford it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He watched her, though, with some uncertainty, as
she sat silent, thinking.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t afford it,&#8221; she said, at last. &#8220;I will be
doing wrong to help you, just as if I let a poison snake
loose where people travel&mdash;for that is what you are.
But I am not strong enough to let these friends go and
start over again; so I will help you away this once.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew a breath of relief, and gathered up his
blanket.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is the way to talk. You&#8217;ve got a level head&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will do,&#8221; she said, curtly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want praise
from a coward, a thief, or a murderer. You are all
three. I have no money here. You will have to come
again for it to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A trick&mdash;is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is no trick. I haven&#8217;t got it, that is all. Maybe I
can&#8217;t get it in money, but I will get it in free gold by
to-morrow at dusk. I will put it here under the pillow,
and will manage to keep the rest away at that time.
You can come as you came this evening, and get it; but
I will neither take it nor send it to you. You will have
to risk your freedom and your life to come for it. But
while I can&#8217;t quite decide to give you up or to kill you,
myself, I hope some one else will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hope what you please,&#8221; he returned, indifferently.
&#8220;So long as you get the dust for me, I can stand your
opinion. And you will have it here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will have it here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I trust you only because I know you can&#8217;t afford to
go back on me,&#8221; he said, as he wrapped the blanket
around him, and dropped his taller form to the height
of Akkomi. &#8220;It is a bargain, then, my dear. Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t wish you a good-night,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I
hope I shall never see you alive again.&#8221;</p>
<p>And she never did.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<h3>&#8217;TANA&#8217;S ENGAGEMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;And she wants a thousand dollars in money or free
gold&mdash;a thousand dollars to-day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No use asking me what for, Dan, for I don&#8217;t know,&#8221;
confessed Lyster. &#8220;I can&#8217;t see why she don&#8217;t tell you
herself; but you know she has been a little queer since
the fever&mdash;childish, whimsical, and all that. Maybe as
she has not yet handled any specie from your bonanza,
she wants some only to play with, and assure herself it
is real.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Less than a thousand in money and dust would do for
a plaything,&#8221; remarked Overton. &#8220;Of course she has a
right to get what she wants; but that amount will be
of no use to her here in camp, where there is not a
thing in the world to spend it for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she wants to pension off some of her Indian
friends before she leaves,&#8221; suggested Max&mdash;&#8220;old Akkomi
and Flap-Jacks, perhaps. I am a little like Miss Slocum
in my wonder as to how she endures them, though, of
course, the squaw is a necessity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, she was not brought up in the world of
Miss Slocum&mdash;or your world, either,&#8221; answered Overton.
&#8220;You should make allowance for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Make allowance&mdash;I?&#8221; and Lyster looked at him
curiously. &#8220;Are you trying to justify her to me? Why,
man, you ought to know by this time what keeps me here
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
a regular lounger around camp, and there is no need
to make excuses for her to me. I thought you knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you&mdash;like her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Worse than that,&#8221; said Max, with his cheery, confident
smile. &#8220;I&#8217;m trying to get her to say she likes me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And she?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, she won&#8217;t meet me as near half-way as I would
like,&#8221; he confessed; &#8220;talks a lot of stuff about not being
brought up right, and not suited to our style of life at
home, and all that. But she did seem rather partial to
me when she was ill and off guard. Don&#8217;t you think so?
That is all I have to go on; but it encourages me to remember
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton did not speak, and Lyster continued speculating
on his chances, when he noticed his companion&#8217;s
silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you speak, Dan? I did hope you would
help me rather than be indifferent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Help you!&#8221; and Lyster was taken aback at the fierce
straightening of the brows and the strange tone in which
the words were uttered. The older man could not but
see his surprised look, for he recovered himself, and
dropped his hand in the old familiar way on Lyster&#8217;s
shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much chance of my helping you when she employs
you as an agent when she wants any service, rather
than exchange words with me herself. Now, that is the
way it looks, Max.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; agreed Lyster. &#8220;And to tell the truth, Dan,
the only thing she does that really vexes me is her queer
attitude toward you of late. I can&#8217;t think she means to
be ungrateful, but&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother about that. Everything has changed
for her lately, and she has her own troubles to think of.
Don&#8217;t you doubt her on my account. Just remember
that. And if&mdash;she says &#8217;yes&#8217; to you, Max, be sure I
would rather see her go to you than any other man I
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is all right,&#8221; observed Lyster, laughingly; &#8220;but
if you only had a love affair or two of your own, you
could perhaps get up more enthusiasm over mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he sauntered off to report the financial interview
to &#8217;Tana, and laughed as he went at the impatient look
flung at him by Overton.</p>
<p>He found &#8217;Tana visiting at the tent of the cousins, who
were using all arguments to persuade her to share their
new abode. Each was horrified to learn that she had
dismissed the squaw at sleeping time, and had remained
in the cabin alone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite alone,&#8221; she corrected, &#8220;for Harris was just
on the other side of the door.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much protection he would be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, Dan Overton was with him. How is he
for protection?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thoroughly competent, no doubt,&#8221; agreed Miss Lavina,
with a rather scandalized look. &#8220;But, my dear,
the propriety?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think Flap-Jacks would help any one out in
propriety?&#8221; retorted &#8217;Tana. &#8220;But we won&#8217;t stumble over
that question long, for I want to leave the camp and
go back to the Ferry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then, &#8217;Tana?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And then&mdash;I don&#8217;t know, Mrs. Huzzard, to school,
maybe&mdash;though I feel old for that, older than either of
you, I am sure&mdash;so old that I care nothing for all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
things I wanted less than a year ago. They are within
my reach now, yet I only want to rest&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not finish the sentence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard, noticing the tired look in her eyes and
the wistfulness of her voice, reached out and patted her
head affectionately.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want, first of all, to grow strong and hearty,
like you used to be&mdash;that is what you need first, then the
rest will all come right in good time. You&#8217;ll want to see
the theaters, and the pictures, and hear the fine music
you used to talk of. And you&#8217;ll travel, and see all the
fine places you used to dream about. Then, maybe, you&#8217;ll
get ambitious, like you used to be, about making pictures
out of clay. For you can have fine teaching now, you
know, and you&#8217;ll find, after a while, that the days will
hardly seem long enough for all the things you want
to do. That is how it will be when you get strong
again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Tana tried to smile at the cheerful picture, but the
smile was not a merry one. Her attention was given
to Lyster and Overton, whom she could see from the
tent door.</p>
<p>How tall and strong Dan looked! Was she to believe
that story of him heard last night? The very possibility
of it made her cheeks burn at the thought of how she
had stood with his arm around her. And he had pitied
her that night. &#8220;Poor little girl!&#8221; he had said. Was his
pity because he saw how much he was to her, while he
himself thought only of some one else? One after another
those thoughts had come to her through the sleepless
night, and when the day came she could not face
him to speak to him of the simplest thing. And of the
money she must have, she could not ask him at all. She
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
wished she could have courage to go to him and tell him
the thing she had heard; but courage was not strong in
her of late. The fear that he might look indifferently
on her and say, &#8220;Yes, it is true&mdash;what then?&#8221;&mdash;the fear
of that was so great that she had walked by the water&#8217;s
edge, as the sun rose, and felt desperate enough to think
of sleep under the waves, as a temptation. For if it was
true&mdash;</p>
<p>The two older women watched her, and decided that
she was not yet strong enough to think of long journeys.
Her hands would tremble at times, and tears, as of weakness,
would come to her eyes, and she scarcely appeared
to hear them when they spoke.</p>
<p>She never walked through the woods as of old, though
sometimes she would stand and look up at the dark hills
with a perfect hunger in her eyes. And when the night
breeze would creep down from the heights, and carry the
sweet wood scents of the forest to her, she would close
her eyes and draw in long breaths of utter content. The
strong love for the wild places was as second nature to
her; yet when Max would ask her to go with him for
flowers or mosses, her answer was always &#8220;no.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she would go to the boat sometimes, though no
longer having strength to use the paddle. It was a good
place to think, if she could only keep the others from
going, too, so she slipped away from Max and the women
and went down. A chunky, good-looking fellow was
mending one of the canoes, and raised his head at her approach,
nodding to her and evidently pleased when she
addressed him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is a shaky old tub,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;but I told
Overton I thought it could be fixed to carry freight for
another trip; so he put me at it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are new in camp, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; she asked, not
caring at all whether he was or not. She was always
friendly with the workmen, and this one smiled and
bowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are all that, I guess,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I came up
the day Haydon and Seldon came. I lived with Seldon
down the country, and was staggered a little, I tell you,
when I found Overton was in charge, and had struck it
rich. But no man deserves good luck more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she agreed. &#8220;Then you knew him before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed&mdash;over in Spokane. He don&#8217;t seem quite
the same fellow, though. We thought he would just go
to the dogs after he left there, for he started to drink
heavily. But he must have settled in his own mind that
it wasn&#8217;t worth while; so here he is, straight as a string,
and counting his dollars by the thousands, and I&#8217;m glad
to see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Drink! He never drinks to excess, that we know
of,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t seem to care for that sort of
thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he didn&#8217;t then, either,&#8221; agreed this loquacious
stranger, &#8220;but a woman can drive as good men as him
to drink; and that is about the way it was. No one
thought any worse of Overton, though&mdash;don&#8217;t think that.
The worst any one could say was that he was too square&mdash;that&#8217;s
all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Too square! She walked away from him a little way,
all her mind aflame with his suggestions. He had taken
to drink and dissipation because of some woman. Was
it the woman whose name she had heard last night? The
key to the thing puzzling her had been dropped almost
at her feet, yet she feared to pick it up. No teaching she
had ever received told her it was unprincipled to steal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
through another the confidence he himself had not chosen
to give her. But some instinct of justice kept her from
further question.</p>
<p>She knew the type of fellow who was rigging up the
canoe, a light-headed, assuming specimen, who had not
yet learned to keep a still tongue in his head, but he did
not impress her as being a deliberate liar. Then, all at
once, she realized who he must be, and turned back.
There was no harm in asking that, at any rate.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the man whom Overton sent to put Harris
to bed last night, are you not?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>He nodded, cheerfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;And your name is Jake Emmons, of the Spokane
country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thet&#8217;s who,&#8221; he assented; &#8220;that&#8217;s where I came across
Lottie Snyder, Overton&#8217;s wife, you know. I was running
a little stage there for a manager, and she&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not asking you about&mdash;about Mr. Overton&#8217;s affairs,&#8221;
she said, and she sat down, white and dizzy, on
the overturned canoe. &#8220;And he might not like it if he
knew you were talking so free. Don&#8217;t do it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;I won&#8217;t. No one here seems
to know about the bad break he made over there; but,
Lord! there was excuse enough. She is one of those
women that look just like a little helpless baby; and that
caught Overton. Young, you know. But I won&#8217;t whisper
her name in camp again, for it is hard on the old man.
But, as you are partners, I guessed you must know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, faintly; &#8220;but don&#8217;t talk, don&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say! You are sick, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; he demanded, as her
voice dropped to a whisper. &#8220;Say! Look here, Miss
Rivers! Great snakes! She&#8217;s fainted!&#8221;</p>
<p>When she opened her eyes again, the rough roof of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
her cabin was above her, instead of the blue sky. The
women folks were using the camp restorative&mdash;whisky&mdash;on
her to such good purpose that her hands and face and
hair were redolent of it, and the amount she had been
forced to swallow was strangling her.</p>
<p>The face she saw first was that of Max&mdash;Max, distressed
and anxious, and even a little pale at sight of her
death-like face.</p>
<p>She turned to him as to a haven of refuge from the
storm of emotion under which she had fallen prostrate.</p>
<p>It was all settled now&mdash;settled forever. She had heard
the worst, and knew she must go away&mdash;away from
where she must see that one man, and be filled with
humiliation if ever she met his gaze. A man with a wife
somewhere&mdash;a man into whose arms she had crept!</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you in pain?&#8221; asked Miss Lavina, as &#8217;Tana
groaned and shut her eyes tight, as if to bar out memory.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;nothing ails me. I was without a hat, and the
sun on my head made me sick, I suppose,&#8221; she answered,
and arose on her elbow. &#8220;But I am not going to be a
baby, to be watched and carried around any more. I am
going to get up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just outside her door Overton stood; and when he
heard her voice again, with its forced independent words,
he walked away content that she was again herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to get up,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;I am going
away from here to-morrow or next day&mdash;and there
are things to do. Help me, Max.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Best thing you can do is to lie still an hour or two,&#8221;
advised Mrs. Huzzard, but the girl shook her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m going to get up,&#8221; she said, with grim decision;
and when Lyster offered his hand to help her, she
took it, and, standing erect, looked around at the couch.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is the last time I&#8217;m going to be thrown on you for
any such fool cause,&#8221; she said, whimsically. &#8220;Who toted
me in here&mdash;you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I? Not a bit of it,&#8221; confessed Lyster. &#8220;Dan reached
you before any of the others knew you were ill. He
carried you up here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He? Oh!&#8221; and she shivered a little. &#8220;I want to
talk to Harris. Max, come with me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He went wonderingly, for he could see she was excited
and nervous. Her hand trembled as it touched his, but
her mouth was set so firmly over the little white teeth
that he knew it was better to humor her than fret her
by persuading her to rest.</p>
<p>But once beside Harris, she sat a long time in silence,
looking out from the doorway across the level now active
with the men of the works. Not until the two cousins
had walked across to their other shelter did she speak,
and then it was to Harris.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe, I am sick,&#8221; she confessed; &#8220;not sick with the
fever, but heartsick and headsick. You know how and
maybe why.&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded his head, and looked at Lyster questioningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I&#8217;ve come in here to tell you something. Max,
you won&#8217;t mind. He can&#8217;t talk, but knows me better
than you do, I guess; for I&#8217;ve come to him before when
I was troubled, and I want to tell him what you said to
me in the boat.&#8221;</p>
<p>Max stared at her, but silently agreed when he saw she
was in earnest. He even reached out his hand to take
hers, but she drew away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till I tell him,&#8221; she said, and turned to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
helpless man in the chair. &#8220;He asked me to marry him&mdash;some
day. Would it be right for me to say yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana!&#8221; exclaimed Lyster; but she raised her hand
pleadingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any other person in the world I could go
to and ask,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He knows me better than you do,
Max, and I&mdash;Oh! I don&#8217;t think I should be always contented
with your ways of living. I was born different&mdash;a
heap different. But to-day it seems as if I am not
strong enough to do without&mdash;some one&mdash;who likes me,
and I do want to say &#8217;yes&#8217; to you, yet I&#8217;m afraid it is
only because I am sick at heart and lonely.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a declaration likely to cool the ardor of most
lovers, but Lyster reached out his hand to her and
laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you dear girl,&#8221; he said, fondly. &#8220;Did your conscience
make it necessary for you to confess in this
fashion? Now listen. You are weak and nervous;
you need some one to look after you. Doesn&#8217;t she, Harris?
Well, take me on trial. I will devote myself to
your interests for six months, and if at the end of that
time you find that it was only sickness and loneliness
that ailed you, and not liking me, then I give you my
word I&#8217;ll never try to hold you to a promise. You will
be well and strong by that time, and I&#8217;ll stand by the
decision you make then. Will you say &#8217;yes,&#8217; now?&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked at Harris, who nodded his head. Then she
turned and gave her hand to Max.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But if you should be sorry&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not another word,&#8221; he commanded; &#8220;the &#8217;yes&#8217; is all
I want to hear just now; when I get sorry I&#8217;ll let you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that is the way their engagement began.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<h3>LAVINA AND THE CAPTAIN.</h3>
</div>

<p>As the day wore on, &#8217;Tana became more nervous and
restless. With the dark, that man was to come for the
gold she had promised.</p>
<p>Lyster brought it to her, part in money, part in free
gold, and as he laid it on the couch, she looked at him
strangely.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much you trust me when you never even ask
what I am to do with all this!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Yet it is enough
to surprise you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;But when you are ready you
will tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I will not tell you,&#8221; she answered, &#8220;but it is the
last thing&mdash;I think&mdash;that I will keep from you, Max.
It is a debt that belongs to days before I knew you.
What did Overton say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much, maybe he will leave for the upper works
this evening or to-morrow morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you&mdash;did you tell him&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you are going to belong to me? Well, no, I
did not. You forgot to give me permission.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face flushed shyly at his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must think me a queer girl, Max,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;And you are so good and patient with me, in spite of
my queer ways. But, never mind; they will not last
always, I hope.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Which?&mdash;my virtues or your queerness?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She only smiled and pushed the gold under the pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go away now for a little while. I want to rest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, rest if you like; but don&#8217;t think. You have
been fretting over some little personal troubles until you
fancy them heavy enough to overbalance the world. But
they won&#8217;t. And I&#8217;m not going to try and persuade you
into Haydon&#8217;s house, either, now that you&#8217;ve been good
to me; unless, of course, you fall in love with Margaret,
and want to be with her, and it is likely to happen. But
Uncle Seldon and my aunts will be delighted to have
you, and you could live as quiet as you please there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I am likely to fall in love with Margaret, am I?&#8221;
she asked. &#8220;Why? Does everybody? Did you&mdash;Max?
Now, don&#8217;t blush like that, or I&#8217;ll be sure of it. I never
saw you blush so pretty before. It made you almost
good looking. Now go; I want to be alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sha&#8217;n&#8217;t I send one of the ladies up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a soul! Go, Max. I am tired.&#8221;</p>
<p>So he went, in all obedience, and he and the cousins
had a long talk about the girl and the danger of leaving
her alone another night. Her sudden illness showed
them she was not strong enough yet to be allowed to
guide herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall try hard to get her to leave to-morrow, or
next day,&#8221; said Lyster. &#8220;Where is Dan? I would like
to talk to him about it, but he has evidently disappeared.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to think of Dan Overton,&#8221; confessed
Mrs. Huzzard. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t ever around, chatty and
sociable, like he used to be. When we do see him, he is
nearly always busy; and when he isn&#8217;t busy, he strikes
for the woods.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe he is still searching for new gold mines,&#8221; suggested
Miss Lavina. &#8220;I notice he does seem very much
engaged in thought, and is of a rather solitary nature.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never was before,&#8221; protested her cousin. &#8220;And if
these gold finds just twist a person&#8217;s nature crosswise,
or send them into a fever, then I hope the good Lord&#8217;ll
keep the rest of them well covered up in future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lorena Jane,&#8221; said Miss Lavina, in a reproachful
tone, &#8220;it is most essential that you free yourself from
those very forcible expressions. They are not a bit
genteel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I reckon they ain&#8217;t, Lavina; and the more I
try the more I&#8217;m afraid I never will be. Land sakes, if
folks would only teach their young ones good manners
when they are young, what a sight of mortified feelings
would be saved after a while!&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyster left them in the midst of the very earnest plea
for better training, for he espied a new boat approaching
camp. As it came closer, he found that among the other
freight it carried was the autocrat of Sinna Ferry&mdash;Captain
Leek.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a God-forsaken wilderness!&#8221; he exclaimed,
and looked around with a supercilious air, suggesting
that he would have given the Creator of the Kootenai
country valuable points if he had been consulted. &#8220;Well,
my dear young fellow, how you have managed to exist
here for three weeks I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we had Mrs. Huzzard,&#8221; explained Max, with
a twinkle in his eye; &#8220;and she is a panacea for many ills.
She has made our wilderness very endurable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; excellent woman,&#8221; agreed the other, with
a suspicious look. &#8220;And &#8217;Tana? How is she&mdash;the dear
girl! I really have been much grieved to hear of her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
illness; and at the earliest day I could leave my business
I am here to inquire in person regarding her health.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; and Max struggled with a desire to laugh at
the change in the captain&#8217;s attitude since &#8217;Tana was a
moneyed individual instead of a little waif. Poor &#8217;Tana!
No wonder she looked with suspicion on late-coming
friends.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she is better&mdash;much better,&#8221; he continued, as
they walked up from the boat. &#8220;I suppose you knew that
a cousin of Mrs. Huzzard, a lady from Ohio, has been
with us&mdash;in fact, came up with our party.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I heard&mdash;so I heard. Nice for Mrs. Huzzard. I
was not in town, you know, when you rested at the
Ferry. I heard, however, that a white woman had come
up. Who is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached the tent, and Mrs. Huzzard, after
a frantic dive toward their very small looking glass,
appeared at the door with a smile enchanting, and a
courtesy so nicely managed that it nearly took the captain&#8217;s
breath away. It was the very latest of Lavina&#8217;s
teachings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, I&#8217;m mighty&mdash;hem!&mdash;I&#8217;m extremely
pleased that you have called. Have a nice trip?&#8221;</p>
<p>But the society tone of Mrs. Huzzard was so unlike
the one he had been accustomed to hearing her use, that
the captain could only stare, and before he recovered
enough to reply, she turned and beckoned Miss Slocum,
with the idea of completing the impression made, and
showing with what grace she could present him to her
cousin.</p>
<p>But the lately acquired style was lost on him this time,
overtopped by the presence of Miss Lavina, who gazed
at him with a prolonged and steady stare.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And this is your friend, Captain Leek, of the Northern
Army, is it?&#8221; she asked, in her very sharpest voice&mdash;a
voice she tried to temper with a smile about her lips,
though none shone in her eyes. &#8220;I have no doubt you
will be very welcome to the camp, Captain Leek.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard had surely expected of Lavina a much
more gracious reception. But Mrs. Huzzard was a bit
of a philosopher, and if Lavina chose to be somewhat
cold and unresponsive to the presence of a cultured gentleman,
well, it gave Lorena Jane so much better chance,
and she was not going to slight it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come right in; you must be dead tired,&#8221; she said,
cordially. &#8220;Mr. Max, you&#8217;ll let Dan know he&#8217;s here,
won&#8217;t you&mdash;that is, when he does show up again, but
no one knows how long that will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am tired,&#8221; agreed the captain, meekly, and
not quite at his ease with the speculative eyes of Miss
Slocum on him. &#8220;I&mdash;I brought up a few letters that
arrived at the Ferry. I can&#8217;t make up my mind to trust
mail with these Indian boatmen Dan employs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They are a trial,&#8221; agreed Mrs. Huzzard, &#8220;though they
haven&#8217;t the bad effect on our nerves that one or two
of the camp Indians have&mdash;an awful squaw, who helps
around, and an ugly old man, who only smokes and looks
horrible. Now, Lavina&mdash;she ain&#8217;t used to no such, and
she just shivers at them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;ah&mdash;yes,&#8221; murmured the captain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lavina says she knew folks of your name back in
Ohio,&#8221; continued Mrs. Huzzard, cheerfully, in order to
get the two strangers better acquainted. &#8220;I thought at
first maybe you&#8217;d turn out to know each other; but she
says they was Democrats,&#8221; and she turned a sharp glance
toward him, as if to read his political tendencies.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I never knew any Captain Leek,&#8221; said Miss
Slocum, &#8220;and the ones I knew hadn&#8217;t any one in the Union
Army. Their principles, if they had any, were against
it, and there wasn&#8217;t a Republican in the family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, of course, that would settle Captain Leek belonging
to them,&#8221; decided Mrs. Huzzard, promptly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know much about politics, but as all our men folks
wore the blue clothes, and fought in them, I was always
glad I come from a Republican State. And I guess all
the Republicans that carried guns against the Union
could be counted without much arithmetic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I think I will go and look for Dan myself,&#8221; observed
the captain, rising and looking around a little
uncertainly at Miss Slocum. &#8220;I brought some letters
he may want.&#8221;</p>
<p>He made his bow and placed the picturesque corded
hat on his head as he went out. But Mrs. Huzzard
looked after him somewhat anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s sick,&#8221; she decided as he vanished from her view;
&#8220;I never did see him walk so draggy like. And don&#8217;t
you judge his manners, either, Lavina, from this first
sight of him, for he ain&#8217;t himself to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t look to me as though he knew who he was,&#8221;
remarked Lavina; and after a little she looked up from
the tidy she was knitting. &#8220;So, Lorena Jane, that is the
man you&#8217;ve been trying to educate yourself up to more
than for anybody else&mdash;now, tell the truth!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t mind saying that it was his good manners
made me see how bad mine were,&#8221; she confessed;
&#8220;but as for training for him&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; said Miss Lavina, grimly, &#8220;and it is all right;
but I just thought I&#8217;d ask.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></p>
<p>Then she relapsed into deep thought, and made the
needles click with impatience all that afternoon.</p>
<p>The captain came near the tent once, but retreated at
the vision of the knitter. He talked with Mrs. Huzzard
in the cabin of Harris, but did not visit her again in her
own tent; and the poor woman began to wonder if the
air of the Kootenai woods had an erratic influence on
people. Dan was changed, &#8217;Tana was changed, and now
the captain seemed unlike himself from the very moment
of his arrival. Even Lavina was a bit curt and indifferent,
and Lorena Jane wondered where it would end.</p>
<p>In the midst of her perplexity, &#8217;Tana added to it by
appearing before her in the Indian dress Overton had
presented her with. Since her sickness it had hung
unused in her cabin, and the two women had fashioned
garments more suitable, they thought, to a young girl who
could wear real laces now if she chose. But there she was
again, dressed like any little squaw, and although rather
pale to suit the outfit, she said she wanted a few more
&#8220;Indian hours&#8221; before departing for the far-off Eastern
city that was to her as a new world.</p>
<p>She received Captain Leek with an unconcern that
was discouraging to the pretty speeches he had prepared
to utter.</p>
<p>Dan returned and looked sharply at her as she sat
whittling a stick of which she said she meant to make a
cane&mdash;a staff for mountain climbing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you intend climbing?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>She waved the stick toward the hill back of them, the
first step of the mountain.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only a few hours since I picked you up down
there, looking as if you were dead,&#8221; he said, impatiently;
&#8220;and you know you are not fit to tramp.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not dead yet, anyway,&#8221; she answered,
with a shrug of her shoulders; &#8220;and as I&#8217;m going to
break away from this camp about to-morrow, I thought
I&#8217;d like to see a bit of the woods first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;are going&mdash;to-morrow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana! And you have not said a word to me of it?
That was not very friendly, little girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not reply, but bent her head low over her
work.</p>
<p>After observing her for a while in silence, he arose and
put on his hat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is my knife,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;You had better
use it, if you are determined to haggle at that stick.
Your own knife is too dull for any use. You can leave
it here in the cabin when you are done with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>She accepted it without a word, but flushed red when
he had gone, and she found the eyes of Harris regarding
her sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Not very friendly,&#8217;&#8221; she said, going over Overton&#8217;s
words&mdash;&#8220;you think that, too&mdash;don&#8217;t you? You think
I&#8217;m ugly, and saucy, and awful, I know! You look
scoldings at me; but if you knew all, maybe you wouldn&#8217;t&mdash;if
you knew that my heart is just about breaking. I&#8217;m
going out where there is no one to talk to, or I&#8217;ll be crying
next.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two cousins and the captain were in &#8217;Tana&#8217;s cabin.
Mrs. Huzzard was determined that Miss Slocum and the
captain should become acquainted, and, getting sight of
the girl, who was walking alone across the level, she
at once followed her, thinking that the two left behind
would perhaps become more social if left entirely to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
themselves. And they did; that is, they talked, and the
captain spoke first.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&mdash;you bear a grudge&mdash;don&#8217;t you, Lavina?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess if I owed you a very heavy one, I&#8217;ve
got a good chance to pay it off now,&#8221; she remarked,
grimly.</p>
<p>He twirled his hat in a dejected way, and did not
speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;You an officer in the Union Army?&#8221; she continued,
derisively. &#8220;You a pattern of what a gentleman should
be; you to set up as superior to these rough-handed
miners; you to act as if this Government owes you a
pension! Why, how would it be with you, Alf Leek, if
I&#8217;d tell this camp the truth of how you went away, engaged
to me, twenty-five years ago, and never let me set
eyes on you since&mdash;of how I wore black for you, thinking
you were killed in the war, till I heard that you had
deserted. I took off that mourning quick, I can tell you!
I thought you were fighting on the wrong side; yet if
you had a good reason for being there, you should have
staid and fought so long as there was breath in you. And
if I was to tell them here that you haven&#8217;t a particle of
right to wear that blue suit that looks like a uniform, and
that you were no more &#8217;captain&#8217; of anything than I am&mdash;well,
I guess Lorena Jane wouldn&#8217;t have much to say
to you, though maybe Mr. Overton would.&#8221;</p>
<p>He grew actually pale as he listened. His fear of some
one overhearing her was as great as his own mortification.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you&mdash;you won&#8217;t tell&mdash;will you, Lavina?&#8221; he said
pleadingly. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t done any harm! I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harm! Alf Leek, you never had enough backbone
to do either harm or help to any one in this world. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
don&#8217;t you suppose you did me harm when you spoiled
me for ever trusting any other man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I would have come back, but I thought you&#8217;d be
married,&#8221; he said, in a feeble, hopeless way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely that is now, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; she demanded. And,
woman-like, now that she had reduced him to meekness
and humiliation, she grew a shade less severe, as if pretty
well satisfied. &#8220;I had other things to think of besides a
husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t tell&mdash;will you, Lavina? I&#8217;ll tell you how
it all happened, some day. Then I&#8217;ll leave this country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not,&#8221; she contradicted. &#8220;You&#8217;ll stay right here
as long as I do, and I won&#8217;t tell just so long as you keep
from trying to make Lorena Jane believe how great you
are. But at the first word of your heroic actions, or the
cultured society you were always used to&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never hear of them,&#8221; he said eagerly, &#8220;never.
I knew you wouldn&#8217;t make trouble, Lavina, for you always
were such a good, kind-hearted girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>He offered his hand to her, sheepishly, and she gave
it a vixenish slap.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try any of your skim-milk praise on me,&#8221; she
said, tartly. &#8220;Huh! You, that Lorena thought was a
pillar of cultured society! When, the Lord knows, you
wouldn&#8217;t have known how to read the addresses on your
own letters if I hadn&#8217;t taught you!&#8221;</p>
<p>He moved to the door in a crestfallen manner, and
stood there a moment, moistening his lips, and apparently
swallowing words that could not be uttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so, Lavina,&#8221; he said, at last, and went out.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she muttered aggrievedly&mdash;&#8220;that&#8217;s Alf Leek,
just as he always was. Give him a chance, and he&#8217;d ride
over any one; but get the upper hand of him, and he is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
meeker than Moses. Not that much meekness is needed
to come up to Moses, either.&#8221; Then, after an impatient
tattoo, she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious me! I do wish he hadn&#8217;t looked so crushed,
and had talked back a little.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<h3>THE MURDER.</h3>
</div>

<p>That evening, as the dusk fell, a slight figure in an
Indian dress slipped to the low brush back of the cabin,
and thence to the uplands.</p>
<p>It was &#8217;Tana, ready to endure all the wilds of the
woods, rather than stay there and meet again the man
she had met the night before. She had sent the squaw
away; she had arranged in Mrs. Huzzard&#8217;s tent a little
game of cards that would hold the attention of Lyster and
the others; and then she had slipped away, that she might,
for just once more, feel free on the mountain, as she had
felt when they first located their camp in the sweet grass
of the Twin Springs.</p>
<p>The moon would be up after a while. She could not
walk far, but she meant to sit somewhere up there in
the high ground until the moon should roll up over the
far mountains.</p>
<p>The mere wearing of the Indian dress gave her a
feeling of being herself once more, for in the pretty conventional
dress made for her by Mrs. Huzzard, she felt
like another girl&mdash;a girl she did not know very well.</p>
<p>In the southwest long streaks of red and yellow lay
across the sky, and a clear radiance filled the air, as it
does when a new moon is born after the darkness. She
felt the beauty of it all, and stretched out her arms as
though to draw the peaks of the hills to her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span></p>
<p>But, as she stepped forward, a form arose before her&mdash;a
tall, decided form, and a decided voice said:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, &#8217;Tana, you have gone far enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;it is Dan this time, and not the other fellow.
If he is waiting for you to-night, I will see that he waits
a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you!&#8221; she murmured, and stepped back from
him. Then, her first fright over, she straightened herself
defiantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you think any one is waiting for me?&#8221; she
demanded. &#8220;What do you know? I am heartsick with
all this hiding, and&mdash;and deceit. If you know the truth,
speak out, and end it all!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say any more than you know already,&#8221; he
answered&mdash;&#8220;not so much; but last night a man was in
your cabin, a man you know and quarreled with. I didn&#8217;t
hear you; don&#8217;t think I was spying on you. A miner
who passed the cabin heard your voices and told me
something was wrong. You don&#8217;t give me any right to
advise you or dictate to you, &#8217;Tana, but one thing you
shall not do, that is, steal to the woods to meet him. And
if I find him in your cabin, I promise you he sha&#8217;n&#8217;t die
of old age.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You would kill him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like a snake!&#8221; and his voice was harsher, colder,
than she had ever heard it. &#8220;I&#8217;m not asking you any
questions, &#8217;Tana. I know it was the man whom you&mdash;saw
that night at the spring, and would not let me follow.
I know there is something wrong, or he would
come to see you, like a man, in daylight. If the others
here knew it, they would say things not kind to you.
And that is why it sha&#8217;n&#8217;t go on.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sha&#8217;n&#8217;t? What right have you&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will say none,&#8221; he answered, curtly, &#8220;because
you do not know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not know what?&#8221; she interrupted, but he only
drew a deep breath and shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tana, don&#8217;t meet this man again,&#8221; he said, pleadingly.
&#8220;Trust me to judge for you. I don&#8217;t want to be
harsh with you. I don&#8217;t want you to go away with hard
thoughts against me. But this has got to stop&mdash;you must
promise me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I refuse?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;d look for the man, and he never would meet
you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little shiver ran over her as he spoke. She knew
what he meant, and, despite her bitter words last night
to her visitor, the thought was horrible to her that Dan&mdash;</p>
<p>She covered her face with her hands and turned away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do that, little girl,&#8221; he said, and laid his hand
on her arm. &#8220;&#8217;Tana!&#8221;</p>
<p>She flung off his hand as though it stung her, and into
her mind flashed remembrance of Jake Emmons from
Spokane&mdash;of him and his words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch me!&#8221; she half sobbed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you say
another word to me! I am going away to-morrow, and
I have promised to marry Max Lyster.&#8221;</p>
<p>His hand dropped to his side, and his face shone white
in the wan glimmer of the stars.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have promised that?&#8221; he said, at last, drawing
his breath hard through his shut teeth. &#8220;Well&mdash;it is
right, I suppose&mdash;right. Come! I will take you back to
him now. He is the best one to guard you. Come!&#8221;</p>
<p>She drew away and looked from him across to where
the merest rim of the rising moon was to be seen across
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
the hills. The thought of that other night came to her,
the night when they had stood close to each other in the
moonlight. How happy she had been for that one little
space of time! And now&mdash;Ah! she scarcely dare allow
him to speak kindly to her, lest she grow weak enough
to long for that blind content once more.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Tana.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go. I will follow after a little,&#8221; she answered, without
turning her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;I may never trouble you to walk with you again,&#8221; he
said, in a low, constrained tone; &#8220;but this time I must
see you safe in the tent before I leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave! Going! Where to?&#8221; she asked, and her
voice trembled in spite of herself. She clasped her hands
tightly, and he could see the flash of the ring he had
given her. She had put it on with the Indian dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;That does not matter much, does it?&#8221; he returned;
&#8220;but somewhere, far enough up the lake not to trouble
you again while you stay. Come.&#8221;</p>
<p>She walked beside him without another word; words
seemed so useless. She had said words over and over
again to herself all that day&mdash;words of his wrong to her
in not telling her of that other woman, words of reproach,
bitter and keen; yet none of her reasoning kept
her from wanting to touch his hand as he walked beside
her.</p>
<p>But she did not. Even when they reached the level
by the springs, she only looked her farewell to him, but
did not speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-by,&#8221; he said, in a voice that was not like Dan&#8217;s
voice.</p>
<p>She merely bowed her head, and walked away toward
the tent where she heard Mrs. Huzzard laughing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>She halted near the cabin, and then hurried on, dreading
to enter it yet, lest she should meet the man she
was trying to avoid.</p>
<p>Overton watched her until she reached the tent. The
moon had just escaped the horizon, and threw its soft
misty light over all the place. He pulled his hat low
over his eyes, and, turning, took the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Only a few minutes elapsed when Lyster remembered
he had promised Dan to look after Harris, and rose to
go to the cabin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go, too,&#8221; said &#8217;Tana, filled with nervous dread
lest he encounter some one on her threshold, though she
had all reason to expect that her disguised visitor had
come and gone ere that.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, &#8217;Tana, you are a restless mortal,&#8221; said
Mrs. Huzzard. &#8220;You&#8217;ve only just come, and now you
must be off again. What did you do that you wanted
to be all alone for this evening? Read verses, I&#8217;ll go
bail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I didn&#8217;t read verses,&#8221; answered &#8217;Tana. &#8220;But you
needn&#8217;t go along to the cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I will then. You are not fit to sleep alone.
And, if it wasn&#8217;t for the beastly snakes!&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go and see Harris,&#8221; said the girl, and so they
entered his cabin, where he sat alone with a bright light
burning.</p>
<p>Some newspapers, brought by the captain, were spread
before him on a rough reading stand rigged up by one of
the miners.</p>
<p>He looked pale and tired, as though the effort of perusing
them had been rather too much for him.</p>
<p>Listen as she might, the girl could hear never a sound
from her own cabin. She stood by the blanket door,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
connecting the two rooms, but not a breath came to
her. She sighed with relief at the certainty that he had
come and gone. She would never see him again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I light your lamp?&#8221; asked Lyster; and, scarce
waiting for a reply, he drew back the blanket and entered
the darkness of the other cabin.</p>
<p>Two of the miners came to the door just then, detailed
to look after Harris for the night. One was the good-natured,
talkative Emmons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glad to see you are so much better, miss,&#8221; he said,
with an expansive smile. &#8220;But you scared the wits nearly
out of me this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then they heard the sputter of a match in the next
room, and a sharp, startled cry from Lyster, as the blaze
gave a feeble light to the interior.</p>
<p>He staggered back among the rest, with the dying
match in his fingers, and his face ashen gray.</p>
<p>&#8220;Snakes!&#8221; half screamed Mrs. Huzzard. &#8220;Oh, my!
oh, my!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Tana, after one look at Lyster, tried to enter the room,
but he caught and held her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, dear!&mdash;don&#8217;t go in there! It&#8217;s awful&mdash;awful!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221; demanded one of the miners, and
picked up a lamp from beside Harris.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look! It is Akkomi!&#8221; answered Lyster.</p>
<p>At the name &#8217;Tana broke from him and ran into the
room, even before the light reached it.</p>
<p>But she did not take many steps. Her foot struck
against something on the floor, an immovable body and
a silent one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Akkomi&mdash;sure enough,&#8221; said the miner, as he saw the
Indian&#8217;s blanket. &#8220;Drunk, I suppose&mdash;Indian fashion.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>But as he held the light closer, he took hold of the
girl&#8217;s arm, and tried to lead her from the scene.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better leave this to us, miss,&#8221; he added, in a
grave tone. &#8220;The man ain&#8217;t drunk. He&#8217;s been murdered!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8217;Tana, white as death itself, shook off his grasp and
stood with tightly clasped hands, unheeding the words of
horror around her, scarce hearing the shriek of Mrs.
Huzzard, as that lady, forgetful even of the snakes, sank
to the floor, a very picture of terror.</p>
<p>&#8217;Tana saw the roll of money scattered over the couch;
the little bag of free gold drawn from under the pillow.
He had evidently been stooping to secure it when the
assassin crept behind him and left him dead there, with
a knife sticking between his shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;The very knife you had to-day!&#8221; said Lyster, horror-stricken
at the sight.</p>
<p>The miner with the lamp turned and looked at her
strangely, and his eyes dropped from her face to her
clasped hands, on which the ring of the snakes glittered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your knife?&#8221; he asked, and others, attracted by Mrs.
Huzzard&#8217;s scream, stood around the doors and looked at
her too.</p>
<p>She nodded her head, scarce understanding the significance
of it, and never taking her eyes from the dead
man, whose face was yet hidden.</p>
<p>&#8220;He may not be dead,&#8221; she said, at last. &#8220;Look!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s dead, safe enough,&#8221; and Emmons lifted his
hand. &#8220;Was he trying to rob you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;no&mdash;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she answered, vaguely.</p>
<p>Then another man turned the body over, and utter
surprise was on every face; for, though it was Akkomi&#8217;s
blanket, it was a much younger man who lay there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A white man, by Heavens!&#8221; said the miner who had
first entered. &#8220;A white man, with brown paint on his
face and hands! But, look here!&#8221; and he pulled down
the collar of the dead man&#8217;s shirt, and showed a skin fair
as a child&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something terribly crooked here,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;Where is Overton?&#8221;</p>
<p>Overton! At the name her very heart grew cold within
her. Had he not threatened he would kill the man who
visited her at night? Had he come straight to the cabin
after leaving her? Had he kept his word? Had he&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think Overton left camp after supper&mdash;started for
the lake,&#8221; answered some one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll do our best to get it straight without him,
then. Some of you see what time it is. This man has
been dead about a half hour. Mr. Lyster, you had better
write down all about it; and, if any one here has any information
to give, let him have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>His eyes were on the girl&#8217;s face, but she said nothing,
and he bent to wipe off the stain from the dead man&#8217;s
face. Some one brought water, and in a little while was
revealed the decidedly handsome face of a man about
forty-five years old.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do any of you know him?&#8221; asked the miner, who, by
circumstance, appeared to have been given the office of
speaker&mdash;&#8220;look&mdash;all of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>One after another the men approached, but shook their
heads; until an old miner, gray-haired and weather-beaten,
gave vent to a half-smothered oath at sight of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Know him?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Well, I do, though it&#8217;s
five years since I saw him. Heavens! I&#8217;d rather have
found him alive than dead, though, for there is a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
standing reward offered for him by two States. Why, it&#8217;s the
card-sharper, horse-thief and renegade&mdash;Lee Holly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But who could have killed him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is Overton&#8217;s knife,&#8221; said one of the men.</p>
<p>&#8220;But Overton had not had it since noon,&#8221; said &#8217;Tana,
speaking for the first time in explanation. &#8220;I borrowed
it then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You borrowed it? For what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I forget. To cut a stick with, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You think. I&#8217;m sorry to speak rough to a lady, miss
but this is a time for knowing&mdash;not thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221; demanded Lyster.</p>
<p>The man looked at him squarely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to offend innocent folks,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;A
murder has been done in this lady&#8217;s room, with a knife
she acknowledges she has had possession of. It&#8217;s natural
enough to question her first of all.&#8221;</p>
<p>The color had crept into her face once more. She knew
what the man meant, and knew that the longer they
looked on her with suspicion, the more time Overton
would have to escape. Then, when they learned they
were on a false scent, it would be late&mdash;too late to start
after him. She wished he had taken the money and the
gold. She shuddered as she thought him a murderer&mdash;the
murderer of that man; but, with what skill she could,
she would keep them off his track.</p>
<p>Her thoughts ran fast, and a half smile touched her
lips. Even with that dead body at her feet, she was almost
happy at the hope of saving him. The others noticed
it, and looked at her in wonder. Lyster said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right. But Miss Rivers could know nothing
of this. She has been with us since the moon rose, and
that is more than a half-hour.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, only fifteen minutes,&#8221; said one of the men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, where were you for the half-hour before the
moon rose?&#8221; asked the man who seemed examiner.
&#8220;That is really the time most interesting to this case.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, good heavens, man!&#8221; cried Lyster, but &#8217;Tana
interrupted:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was walking up on the hill about that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard groaned dismally, and Lyster caught
&#8217;Tana by the hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana! think what you are saying. You don&#8217;t realize
how serious this is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;One more question,&#8221; and the man looked at her
very steadily. &#8220;Were you not expecting this man to-night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t answer any more of your questions,&#8221; she
answered, coldly.</p>
<p>Lyster turned on the man with clenched hands and a
face white with anger.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you insult her with such a question?&#8221; he
asked, hoarsely. &#8220;How could it be possible for Miss
Rivers to know this renegade horse-thief?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you,&#8221; said the man, drawing a long
breath and looking at the girl. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t a pleasant thing
to do; but as we have no courts up here, we have to
straighten out crimes in a camp the best way we can.
My name is Saunders. That man over there is right&mdash;this
is Lee Holly; and I am sure now that I saw him leave
this cabin last night. I passed the cabin and heard
voices&mdash;hers and a man&#8217;s. I heard her say: &#8216;While I
can&#8217;t quite decide to kill you myself, I hope some one
else will.&#8217; The rest of their words were not so clear. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
told Overton when he came back, but the man was
gone then. You ask me how I dare think she could tell
something of this if she chose. Well, I can&#8217;t help it.
She is wearing a ring I&#8217;ll swear I saw Lee Holly wear
three years ago, at a card table in Seattle. I&#8217;ll swear it!
And he is lying here dead in her room, with a knife
sticking in him that she had possession of to-day. Now,
gentlemen, what do you think of it yourselves?&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<h3>GOOD-BY.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8217;Tana, it is awful&mdash;awful!&#8221; and poor Mrs. Huzzard
rocked herself in a spasm of woe. &#8220;And to think
that you won&#8217;t say a word&mdash;not a single word! It just
breaks my heart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, now! I&#8217;ll say lots of things if you will talk
of something besides murders. And I&#8217;ll mend your
broken heart when this trouble is all over, you will see!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Over! I&#8217;m mightily afraid it is only commencing.
And you that cool and indifferent you are enough to put
one crazy! Oh, if Dan Overton was only here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl smiled. All the hours of the night had gone
by. He had at least twelve hours&#8217; start, and the men
of the camp had not yet suspected him for even a moment.
They had questioned Harris, and he told them, by
signs, that no man had gone through his cabin, no one
had been in since dark; but he had heard a movement
in the other room. The knife he had seen &#8217;Tana take into
the other room long before dark.</p>
<p>&#8220;And some one quarreling with this Holly&mdash;or following
him&mdash;may have chanced on it and used it,&#8221; contested
Lyster, who was angered, dismayed, and puzzled
at &#8217;Tana, quite as much as at the finding of the body.
Her answers to all questions were so persistently detrimental
to her own cause.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be uneasy&mdash;they won&#8217;t hang me,&#8221; she assured
him. &#8220;Think of them hanging any one for killing Lee
Holly! The man who did it&mdash;if he knows whom he
was settling for&mdash;was a fool not to face the camp and
get credit for it. Every man would have shaken hands
with him. But just because there is a little mystery
about it, they try to make it out a crime. Pooh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, child!&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. Huzzard, totally scandalized.
&#8220;A murder! Of course it is a crime&mdash;the greatest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think so. It is a greater crime to bring a
soul into the world and then neglect it&mdash;let it drift into
any hell on earth that nets it&mdash;than it is to send a soul
out of the world, to meet heaven, if it deserves it. There
are times when murder is justifiable, but there are certain
other crimes that nothing could ever justify.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, &#8217;Tana!&#8221; and Mrs. Huzzard looked at her helplessly.
But Miss Slocum gave the girl a more understanding
regard.</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak very bitterly for a young girl; as if you
had thought a great deal on this question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have,&#8221; she acknowledged, promptly; &#8220;you think it
is not a very nice question for girls to study about,
don&#8217;t you? Well, it isn&#8217;t nice, but it&#8217;s true. I happen to
be one of the souls dragged into life by people who
didn&#8217;t think they had responsibilities. Miss Slocum,
maybe that is why I am extra bitter on the subject.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But not&mdash;not against your parents, &#8217;Tana?&#8221; said
Mrs. Huzzard, in dismay.</p>
<p>The girl&#8217;s mouth drew hard and unlovely at the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know much about religion,&#8221; she said, after
a little, &#8220;and I don&#8217;t know that it matters much&mdash;now
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
don&#8217;t faint, Mrs. Huzzard! but I&#8217;m pretty certain old
married men who had families were the ones who laid
down the law about children in the Bible. They say
&#8217;spare the rod and spoil the child,&#8217; and then say &#8216;honor
your father and mother.&#8217; They seem to think it a settled
thing that all fathers and mothers are honorable&mdash;but
they ain&#8217;t; and that all children need beating&mdash;and they
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, &#8217;Tana!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I think it is that one-sided commandment that
makes folks think that all the duty must go from children
to the parents, and not a word is said of the duty people
owe to the souls they bring into the world. I don&#8217;t
think it&#8217;s a square deal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A square deal! Why, &#8217;Tana!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it so?&#8221; she asked, moodily. &#8220;You think a girl
is a pretty hard case if she doesn&#8217;t give proper respect
and duty to her parents, don&#8217;t you? But suppose they
are the sort of people no one can respect&mdash;what then?
Seems to me the first duty is from the parent to the
children&mdash;the duty of caring for them, loving them, and
teaching them right. A child can&#8217;t owe a debt of duty
when it never received the duties it should have first.
Oh, I may not say this clearly as I feel it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you know, &#8217;Tana,&#8221; said Miss Slocum, &#8220;that if
there is no commandment as to parents giving care to
their children, it is only because it is so plainly a natural
thing to do that it was unnecessary to command it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No more natural than for a child to honor any person
who is honorable, or to love the parent who loves
him, and teaches him rightly. Huh! If a child is not
able to love and respect a parent, it is the child who
loses the most.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>Miss Slocum looked at her sadly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t scold you as I would try to scold many a one
in your place,&#8221; she said, &#8220;for I feel as if you must have
traveled over some long, hard path of troubles, before
you could reach this feeling you have. But, &#8217;Tana, think
of brighter things; young girls should never drift into
those perplexing questions. They will make you melancholy
if you brood on such things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Melancholy? Well, I think not,&#8221; and she smiled
and shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;Seems to me I&#8217;m the least
gloomy person in camp this morning. All the rest of
you look as though Mr. Holly had been your bosom
friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>She talked recklessly&mdash;they thought heartlessly&mdash;of
the murder, and the two women were strongly inclined
to think the shock of the affair had touched her
brain, for she showed no concern whatever as to her
own position, but treated it as a joke. And when she
realized that she was to a certain extent under guard,
she seemed to find amusement in that, too. Her expressions,
when the cousins grew pitiful over the handsome
face of Holly, were touched with ridicule.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if there was ever a man too low and vile
to get woman&#8217;s pity, if he only had a pretty face,&#8221; she
said, caustically. &#8220;If he was an ugly, old, half-decent
fellow, you wouldn&#8217;t be making any soft-hearted surmises
as to what he might have been under different circumstances.
He has spoiled the lives of several tenderhearted
women like you&mdash;yet you pity him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana, I never knew you to be so set against any
one as you are against that poor dead man,&#8221; declared
Mrs. Huzzard. &#8220;Not so much wonder the folks think
you know how it happened, for you always had a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
helping word for the worst old tramp or beggarly Indian that
came around; but for this man you have nothing but
unkindness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed the girl, &#8220;and you would like to think
him a romantic victim of somebody, just because he is
so good-looking. I&#8217;m going to talk to Harris. He won&#8217;t
sympathize with the wrong side, I am sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked up eagerly as she entered, his eyes full of
anxious question. She touched his hand kindly and sat
close beside him as she talked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to know all about it, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; she
asked, softly. &#8220;Well, it is all over. He was alive, after
all, and I would not believe it. But now you need
never trail him again, you can rest now, for he is dead.
Somebody else has&mdash;has owed him a grudge, too. They
think I am the somebody, but you don&#8217;t believe that?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head decidedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she continued; &#8220;though for one moment, Joe,
I thought that it might have been you. Yes, I did; for
of course I knew it was only weakness would keep you
from it, if you were in reach of him. But I remembered
at once that it could not be, for the hand that struck him
was strong.&#8221;</p>
<p>He assented in his silent way, and watched her face
closely, as if to read the shadows of thought thrown on
it by her feelings.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awful, ain&#8217;t it?&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;It is what I
said I hoped for, and just yet I can&#8217;t be sorry&mdash;I can&#8217;t!
But, after this stir is all over, I know it will trouble me,
make me sorry because I am not sorry now. I can&#8217;t
cry, but I do feel like screaming. And see! every once
in a while my hands tremble; I tremble all over. Oh, it
is awful!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>She buried her face in her hands. Only to him did
she show any of the feeling with which the death of the
man touched her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you can&#8217;t tell me anything of how it was done?&#8221;
she said, at last. &#8220;You so near&mdash;did you see any one?&#8221;</p>
<p>She longed to ask if he had seen Overton, but dared
not utter his name, lest he might suspect as she did.
Each hour that went by was an added gain to her for
him. Of course he had struck, not knowing who the
man was. If he had known, it would have been so easy
to say, &#8220;I found him robbing the cabin. I killed him,&#8221;
and there would have been no further question concerning
it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if all the other bars were beaten down between
us, this one would keep me from ever shaking hands
with him again. Why should it have been he out of
all the camp? Oh, it makes my heart ache!&#8221;</p>
<p>While she sat thus, with miserable thoughts, others
came to the door, and looking up, she saw Akkomi, who
looked on her with keen, accusing eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;it is not true, Akkomi,&#8221; she said, in his own
jargon. &#8220;Keep silent for a little while of the things
these people do not know&mdash;a little while, and then I can
tell you who it is I am shielding, but not yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Him!&#8221; and the eyes of the Indian turned to the
paralytic.</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;not him; truly not,&#8221; she said, earnestly. &#8220;It
is some one you would want to help if you knew&mdash;some
one who is going fast on the path from these people.
They will learn soon it is not I; but till then, keep
silence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan&mdash;where?&#8221; he asked, laconically, and her face
paled at the question.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>Had he any reason to suspect the dread in her own
mind? But a moment&#8217;s thought reassured her. He had
asked simply because Overton seemed always to him
the controlling spirit of the camp, and Overton was the
one he would have speech with, if any.</p>
<p>&#8220;Overton left last night for the lake,&#8221; explained Lyster,
who had entered and heard the name of Dan and
the interrogative tone. Then the blanket was brought
to Akkomi&mdash;his blanket, in which the man had died.</p>
<p>&#8220;I sold it to the white man&mdash;that is all,&#8221; he answered
through &#8217;Tana; and more than that he would not say
except to inform them he would wait for Dan. Which
was, in fact, the general desire of the committee organized
to investigate.</p>
<p>They all appeared to be waiting for Dan. Lyster
did not by any means fill his place, simply because Lyster&#8217;s
interest in &#8217;Tana was too apparent, and there was
little of the cool quality of reason in his attitude toward
the mysterious case. He did not believe the ring she
wore had belonged to Holly, though she refused to tell
the source from which it had reached her. He did not
believe the man who said he heard that war of words
at her cabin in the evening&mdash;at least, when others were
about, he acted as if he did not believe it. But when
he and &#8217;Tana chanced to be alone, she felt the doubt
there must be in his mind, and a regret for him touched
her. For his sake she was sorry, but not sorry enough
to clear the mystery at the expense of that other man
she thought she was shielding.</p>
<p>Captain Leek had been dispatched with all speed to
the lake works, that Seldon, Haydon, and Overton
might be informed of the trouble in camp, and hasten
back to settle it. To send for them was the only thing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
Lyster thought of doing, for he himself felt powerless
against the lot of men, who were not harsh or rude in
any way, but who simply wanted to know &#8220;why&#8221;&mdash;so
many &#8220;whys&#8221; that he could not answer.</p>
<p>Not less trying to him were the several who persisted
in asserting that she had done a commendable
thing&mdash;that the country ought to feel grateful to her,
for the man had made trouble along the Columbia for
years. He and his confederates had done ugly work
along the border, etc., etc.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry you asked me, Max?&#8221; she said, seeing his face
grow gloomy under their cheering (?) assertions.</p>
<p>He did not answer at once, afraid his impatience with
her might make itself apparent in his speech.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not sorry,&#8221; he said, at last; &#8220;but I shall
be relieved when the others arrive from the lake. Since
you utterly refuse to confide even in me, you render me
useless as to serving you; and&mdash;well&mdash;I can&#8217;t feel flattered
that you confide in me no more than in the strangers
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she agreed, with a little sigh, &#8220;it is hard on
you, and it will be harder still if the story of this should
ever creep out of the wilderness to the country where
you come from&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221; and she looked at him
very sharply, noting the swift color flush his face, as
though she had read his thoughts. &#8220;Yes&mdash;so it&#8217;s lucky,
Max, that we haven&#8217;t talked to others about that little
conditional promise, isn&#8217;t it? So it will be easier to forget,
and no one need know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you think me the sort of fellow to break
our engagement just because these fools have mixed
you up with this horror?&#8221; he asked, angrily. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
no right to think that of me; neither have you the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
right&mdash;in justice to me as well as yourself&mdash;to maintain
this very suggestive manner about all things connected
with the murder. Why can you not tell more clearly
where your time was spent last evening? Why will
you not tell where the ring came from? Why will you
see me half-frantic over the whole miserable affair, when
you could, I am sure, easily change it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Max, I don&#8217;t want to worry you&mdash;indeed I don&#8217;t!
But&mdash;&#8221; and she smiled mirthlessly. &#8220;I told you once I
was a &#8217;hoodoo.&#8217; The people who like me are always
sure to have trouble brewing for them. That is why
I say you had better give me up, Max; for this is only
the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk like that; it is folly,&#8221; he said, in a sharp
tone. &#8220;&#8216;Hoodoo!&#8217; Nonsense! When Overton and the
others arrive, they will find a means of changing the
ideas of these people, in spite of your reticence; and
then maybe old Akkomi may find words, too. He sits
outside the door as impassive as the clay image you gave
me and bewitched me with.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled faintly, thinking of those days&mdash;how very
long ago they seemed, yet it was this same summer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel as if I had lived a long time since I played with
that clay,&#8221; she said, wistfully; &#8220;so many things have
been made different for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she arose and walked about the little room restlessly,
while the eyes of Harris never left her. Into the
other room she had not gone at all, for in it was the dead
stranger.</p>
<p>&#8220;When do you look for your uncle and Mr. Haydon?&#8221;
she asked, at last, for the silences were hardest to endure.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></p>
<p>She would laugh, or argue, or ridicule&mdash;do anything
rather than sit silent with questioning eyes upon her.
She even grew to fancy that Harris must accuse her&mdash;he
watched her so!</p>
<p>&#8220;When do we look for them? Well, I don&#8217;t dare let
myself decide. I only hope they may have made a start
back, and will meet the captain on his way. As to Dan&mdash;he
had not so very much the start, and they ought to
catch up with him, for there were the two Indian canoeists&mdash;the
two best ones; and when they are racing over
the water, with an object, they surely ought to make
better time than he. I can&#8217;t see that he had any very
pressing reason for going at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t talk much about his reasons,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;No; that&#8217;s a fact,&#8221; he agreed, &#8220;and less of late than
when I knew him first. But he&#8217;ll make Akkomi talk,
maybe, when he arrives&mdash;and I hope you, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When he arrives!&#8221;</p>
<p>She thought the words, but did not say them aloud.
She sat long after Max had left her, and thought how
many hours must elapse before they discovered that Dan
had not followed the other men to the lake works. She
felt sure that he was somewhere in the wilderness, avoiding
the known paths, alone, and perhaps hating her as
the cause of his isolation, because she would not confess
what the man was to her, but left him blindly to keep
his threat, and kill him when found in her room.</p>
<p>Ah! why not have trusted him with the whole truth?
She asked herself the question as she sat there, but the
mere thought of it made her face grow hot, and her
jaws set defiantly.</p>
<p>She would not&mdash;she could not! so she told herself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
Better&mdash;better far be suspected of a murder&mdash;live all
her life under the blame of it for him&mdash;than to tell him
of a past that was dead to her now, a past she hated, and
from which she had determined to bar herself as far as
silence could build the wall. And to tell him&mdash;him&mdash;she
could not.</p>
<p>But even as she sat, with her burning face in her
hands, quick, heavy steps came to the door, halted, and
looking up she found Dan before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! you should not,&#8221; she whispered, hurriedly. &#8220;Why
did you come back? They do not suspect; they think
I did it&mdash;and so&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does this all mean?&mdash;what do you mean?&#8221; he
asked. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you speak?&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed she could not find any more words, she
stared at him so helplessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Max, come here!&#8221; he called, to hasten steps already
approaching. &#8220;Come, all of you; I had only a moment
to listen to the captain when he caught up with me. But
he told me she is suspected of murder&mdash;that a ring she
wore last night helped the suspicion on. I didn&#8217;t wait
to hear any more, for I gave the little girl that snake
ring&mdash;gave it to her weeks ago. I bought it from a
miner, and he told me he got it from an Indian near
Karlo. Now are you ready to suspect me, too, because
I had it first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ring wasn&#8217;t just the most important bit of circumstantial
evidence, Mr. Overton,&#8221; answered the man
named Saunders; &#8220;and we are all mighty glad you&#8217;ve
got here. It was in her room the man was found, and
a knife she borrowed from you was what killed him;
and of where she was just about the time the thing
happened she won&#8217;t say anything.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span></p>
<p>His face paled slightly as he looked at her and heard
the brief summing up of the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;My knife?&#8221; he said, blankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. When some one said it was your knife,
she spoke up and said it was, but that you had not had
it since noon, for she borrowed it then to cut a stick;
but beyond that she don&#8217;t tell a thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is the man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The renegade&mdash;Lee Holly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Lee Holly!&#8221; He turned a piercing glance on Harris,
remembering the deep interest he had shown in that man
Lee Holly and his partner, &#8220;Monte.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harris met his gaze without flinching, and nodded
his head as if in assent.</p>
<p>And that was the man found dead in her room!</p>
<p>The faces of the people seemed for a moment an indistinct
blur before his eyes; then he rallied and turned
to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana, you never did it,&#8221; he said, reassuringly; &#8220;or
if you did, it has been justifiable, and I know it. If it
was necessary to do it in any self-defense, don&#8217;t be
afraid to tell it all plainly. No one would blame you.
It is only this mystery that makes them want to hear the
truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>She only looked at him. Was he acting? Did he himself
know nothing? The hope that it was so&mdash;that she
had deceived herself&mdash;made her tremble as she had not
at danger to herself. She had risen to her feet as he
entered, but she swayed as if to fall, and he caught her,
not knowing it was hope instead of despair that took the
color from her face and left her helpless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Courage, &#8217;Tana! Tell us what you can. I left you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
just as the moon came up. I saw you go to Mrs. Huzzard&#8217;s
tent. Now, where did you go after that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; almost shouted Lyster. &#8220;You were with
her when the moon rose. Are you sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure? Of course I am. Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how long before that, Mr. Overton?&#8221; asked
Saunders; &#8220;for that is a very important point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About a half-hour, I should say&mdash;maybe a little
more,&#8221; he answered, staring at them. &#8220;Now, what important
thing does that prove?&#8221;</p>
<p>One of the men gave a cheer; three or four had come
up to the door when they saw Overton, and they took
the yell up with a will. Mrs. Huzzard started to run
from the tent, but grew so nervous that she had to
wait until Miss Slocum came to her aid.</p>
<p>&#8220;What in the world does it mean?&#8221; she gasped.</p>
<p>Saunders turned around with an honestly pleased look.</p>
<p>&#8220;It means that Mr. Overton here has brought word
that clears Miss Rivers of being at the cabin when the
murder was done&mdash;that&#8217;s what it means; and we are
all too glad over it to keep quiet. But why in the world
didn&#8217;t you tell us that, miss?&#8221;</p>
<p>But she did not say a word. All about Dan were
exclamations and disjointed sentences, from which he
could gain little actual knowledge, and he turned to
Lyster, impatiently:</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you tell me&mdash;can&#8217;t some of you tell me, what
I have cleared up for her? When was this killing supposed
to be done?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;At or a little before moonrise,&#8221; said Max, his face
radiant once more. &#8220;&#8217;Tana&mdash;don&#8217;t you know what he
has done for you? taken away all of that horribly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
mistaken suspicion you let rest on you. Where was she,
Dan?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night? Oh, up above the bluff there&mdash;went up
when the pretty red lights were in the sky, and staid
until the moon rose. I came across her up there, and
advised her not to range away alone; so, when she got
good and ready, she walked back again, and went to the
tent where you folks were. Then I struck the creek,
decided I would take a run up the lake, and left without
seeing any of you again. And all this time &#8217;Tana
has had a guard over her. Some of you must have been
crazy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I guess I was the worst lunatic of the lot,&#8221;
confessed Saunders. &#8220;But to tell the truth, Mr. Overton,
it looks to me now as if she encouraged suspicion&mdash;yes,
it does. &#8216;Overton&#8217;s knife,&#8217; said some one; but, quick
as could be, she spoke up and said it was she who had
it, and she didn&#8217;t mind just where she left it. And as to
where she was at that time, well, she just wouldn&#8217;t give
us a bit of satisfaction. Blest if I don&#8217;t think she wanted
us to suspect her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; he breathed, as if in understanding, and her
first words swept back to him, her nervous&mdash;&#8220;Why did
you come back? They suspect me!&#8221; Surely that cry
was as a plea for his own safety; it spoke through eyes
and voice as well as words. Some glimmer of the
truth came to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, &#8217;Tana!&#8221; he said, and reached his hand to her.
&#8220;Where is the man&mdash;Holly? I should like to go in. Will
you come, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>She rose without a word, and no one attempted to follow
them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard heaved a prodigious sigh of content.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that girl Montana!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I declare
she ain&#8217;t like any girl I ever did see! This morning,
when she was a suspected criminal, she was talky, and
even laughed, and now that she&#8217;s cleared, she won&#8217;t lift
her head to look at any one. I do wonder if that sort of
queerness is catching in these woods. I declare I feel
most scared enough to leave.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Lyster reassured her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember how sick she has been; and think what a
shock this whole affair has been to weak nerves,&#8221; he said,
for with Dan&#8217;s revelations he had grown blissfully content
once more, &#8220;and as for that fellow hearing voices
in her cabin&mdash;nonsense! She had been reading some
poem or play aloud. She is fond of reading so, and
does it remarkably well. He heard her spouting in there
for the benefit of Harris, and imagined she was making
threats to some one. Poor little girl! I&#8217;m determined
she sha&#8217;n&#8217;t remain here any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you?&#8221; asked Mrs. Huzzard, dryly. &#8220;Well, Mr.
Max, so long as I&#8217;ve known her, I&#8217;ve always found
&#8217;Tana makes her own determinations&mdash;and sticks to them,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to be reminded of that,&#8221; he retorted, &#8220;for
she promised me yesterday to marry me some time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless my soul!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If she didn&#8217;t change her mind,&#8221; he added, laughingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;To marry you! Well, well, well!&#8221; and she stared at
him so queerly, that a shade of irritation crossed his
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that a plain,
ordinary man is good enough for your wild-flower of
the Kootenai hills?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re not plain at all, Mr. Max Lyster,&#8221; she
returned, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll go bail many a woman who is smarter
than either &#8217;Tana or me has let you know it! It ain&#8217;t
the plainness&mdash;it&#8217;s the difference. And&mdash;well, well!
you know you&#8217;ve been quarreling ever since you met.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is all over now,&#8221; he promised; &#8220;and haven&#8217;t
you a good wish for us?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Indeed I have, then&mdash;a many of them, but you have
surprised me. I used to think that&#8217;s how it would end;
and then&mdash;well, then, a different notion got in my head.
Now that it&#8217;s settled, I do hope you will be happy. Bless
the child! I&#8217;ll go and tell her so this minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he said, quickly, &#8220;let her and Dan have their
talk out&mdash;if she will talk to him. That fever left her
queer in some things, and one of them is her avoidance
of Dan. She hasn&#8217;t been free and friendly with him
as she used to be, and it is too bad; for he is such a good
fellow, and would do anything for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he would,&#8221; assented Mrs. Huzzard.</p>
<p>&#8220;And she will be her own spirited self in a few
weeks&mdash;when she gets away from here&mdash;and gets
stronger. She&#8217;ll appreciate Dan more after a while,
for there are few like him. And so&mdash;as she is to go
away so soon, I hope something will put them on their
former confidential footing. Maybe this murder will
be the something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a good friend, Mr. Max,&#8221; said the woman,
slowly, &#8220;and you deserve to be a lucky lover. I&#8217;m sure
I hope so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Within the cabin, those two of whom they spoke stood
together beside the dead outlaw, and their words were
low&mdash;so low that the paralyzed man in the next room
listened in vain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you believed that of me&mdash;of me?&#8221; he asked,
and she answered, falteringly:</p>
<p>&#8220;How did I know? You said&mdash;you threatened&mdash;you
would kill him&mdash;any man you found in here. So, when
he was here dead, I&mdash;did not know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you thought I had stuck that knife in him and
left?&#8221;</p>
<p>She nodded her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you thought,&#8221; he continued, in a voice slightly
tremulous, &#8220;that you were giving me a chance to escape
just so long as you let them suspect&mdash;you?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not answer, but turned toward the door. He
held his arm out and barred her way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a moment!&#8221; he said, pleadingly. &#8220;It never can
be that&mdash;that I would be anything to you, little girl&mdash;never,
never! But&mdash;just once&mdash;let me tell you a truth
that shall never hurt you, I swear! I love you! No
other word but that will tell your dearness to me. I&mdash;I
never would have said it, but&mdash;but what you risked for
me has broken me down. It has told me more than your
words would tell me, and I&mdash;Oh, God! my God!&#8221;</p>
<p>She shrank from the passion in his words and tone,
but the movement only made him catch her arm and hold
her there. Tears were in his eyes as he looked at her,
and his jaws were set firmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are afraid of me&mdash;of me?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be. Life will be hard enough now without leaving me
that to remember. I&#8217;m not asking a word in return
from you; I have no right. You will be happy somewhere
else&mdash;and with some one else&mdash;and that is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>He still held her wrist, and they stood in silence. She
could utter no word; but her mouth trembled and she
tried to smother a sob that arose in her throat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>But he heard it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t!&#8221; he said, almost in a whisper&mdash;&#8220;for God&#8217;s
sake, don&#8217;t cry. I can&#8217;t stand that&mdash;not your tears.
Here! be brave! Look up at me, won&#8217;t you? See! I
don&#8217;t ask you for a word or a kiss or a thought when
you leave me&mdash;only let me see your eyes! Look at
me!&#8221;</p>
<p>What he read in her trembling lips and her shrinking,
shamed eyes made him draw his breath hard
through his shut teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brave little girl!&#8221; he said softly. &#8220;You will think
harshly of me for this some day&mdash;if you ever know&mdash;know
all. But what you did this morning made a coward
of me&mdash;that and my longing for you. Try to forgive me.
Or, no&mdash;you had better not. And when you are his wife&mdash;Oh,
it&#8217;s no use&mdash;I can&#8217;t think or speak of that&mdash;yet.
Good-by, little girl&mdash;good-by!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<h3>LEAVING CAMP.</h3>
</div>

<p>Afterward, &#8217;Tana never could remember clearly the
incidents of the few days that followed. Only once more
she entered the cabin of death, and that was when Mr.
Haydon and Mr. Seldon returned with all haste to the
camp, after meeting with Captain Leek and the Indian
boatman.</p>
<p>Then, as some of the men offered to go with them
to view the remains of the outlaw, she came forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I will take them,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>When Mr. Haydon demurred, feeling that a young
girl should be kept as much as possible from such
scenes, she had laid her hand on Seldon&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come!&#8221; she said, and they went with her.</p>
<p>But when inside the door, she did not approach the
blanket-covered form stretched on the couch; only
pointed toward it, and stood herself like a guard at the
entrance.</p>
<p>When Seldon lifted the Indian blanket from the face,
he uttered a startled exclamation, and looked strangely at
her. She never turned around.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; asked Mr. Haydon.</p>
<p>No one replied, and as he looked with anxiety toward
the form there, his face grew ashen in its horror.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord in heaven!&#8221; he gasped; &#8220;first her on that bed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
and now <i>him</i>! I&mdash;I feel as if I was haunted in this
camp. Seldon, is it&mdash;is it&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No mistake possible,&#8221; answered the other man, decidedly.
&#8220;I could swear to the identity. It is George
Rankin!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Holly, the renegade!&#8221; added Haydon, in consternation;
&#8220;and Lord only knows how many other
aliases he has worn. Oh, what a sensation the papers
would make over this if they got hold of it all. My!
my! it would be awful! And that girl, Montana, as she
calls herself, she has been clever to keep it quiet as she
has, for&mdash;Oh, Lord!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the matter now? You look fairly sick,&#8221; said
the other, impatiently. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t fancy you&#8217;d grieve
much over his death.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t that,&#8221; said Haydon, huskily. &#8220;But that
girl&mdash;don&#8217;t you see she was accused of this? And&mdash;well
seeing who he is, how do we know&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>He stopped awkwardly, unable to continue with the
girl herself so near and with Seldon&#8217;s warning glance
directed to him.</p>
<p>She leaned against the wall, and apparently had not
heard their words. Seldon&#8217;s face softened as he looked
at her; and, going over, he put his hand kindly on her
hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to be your uncle, now,&#8221; he said in a caressing
tone. &#8220;You have kept up like a soldier under some
terrible things here; but we will try to make things
brighter for you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled in a dreary way without looking at him.
His knowledge of the terrible things she had endured
seemed to her very limited.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will go now with us&mdash;with Mr. Haydon&mdash;back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
to your mother&#8217;s old home, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; he said,
in a persuasive way. &#8220;It is not good, you know, for a
little girl not to know any of her relations, or to bear
such shocking grudges,&#8221; he added, in a lower tone.</p>
<p>But she gave him no answering smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go to your house if you will have me,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;You and Max are my friends. I will go only
with people I like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know, my dear,&#8221; said Mr. Haydon, who heard
her last words. &#8220;You know I offered you a home in
my house until such time as you got to school, and&mdash;and
of course, I&#8217;ll stick to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Though you are a little afraid to risk it, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;
she asked, with an unpleasant smile. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you an
idea that I might murder you all in your beds some fine
night? You know I belong to a country where they do
such things for pastime. Aren&#8217;t you afraid?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is a very horrible sort of pleasantry,&#8221; he answered,
and moved away from the dead face he had been
staring at. &#8220;I beg you will not indulge in it, especially
when you move in a society more refined than these
mining camps can afford. It will be a disadvantage to
you if you carry with you customs and memories of this
unfinished section. And after all, you do not belong
here, your family was of the East. When you go back
there, it would be policy for you to forget that you had
ever lived anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Haydon had never made so long a speech to her
before, and it was delivered with a certain persistence,
as if it was a matter of conscience he would be relieved
to have off his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are mistaken when you say I do not
belong here,&#8221; she answered, coolly. &#8220;Some of my family
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
have been a good many things I don&#8217;t intend to be. I
was born in Montana; and I might have starved to
death for any help my &#8217;family&#8217; would have given me, if
I hadn&#8217;t struck luck and helped myself here in Idaho.
So I think I belong out here, and if I live, I will come
back again&mdash;some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned to Seldon and pointed to the dead form.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will take him away to-day&mdash;I heard them say
so,&#8221; she said quietly. &#8220;Let it be somewhere away from
the camp&mdash;not near&mdash;not where I can see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you forget&mdash;even now, &#8217;Tana?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does anybody ever forget?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;When people
say they can forget and forgive, I don&#8217;t trust them,
for I don&#8217;t believe them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you any idea who killed him?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;It
is certainly a strange affair. I thought you might suspect
some one these people know nothing of.&#8221;</p>
<p>But she shook her head. &#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There were
several who would have liked to do it, I suppose&mdash;people
he had wronged or ruined; for he had few friends left, or
he would not have come across to these poor reds to
hide. Give old Akkomi part of that gold; he was faithful
to me&mdash;and to him, too. No, I don&#8217;t know who did
it. I don&#8217;t care, now. I thought I knew once; but I
was wrong. This way of dying is better than the rope;
and that is what the law would have given him. He
would have chosen this&mdash;I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever in your life hear such cold-blooded
words from a girl?&#8221; demanded Haydon, when she left
them and went to Harris. &#8220;Afraid of her? Humph!
Well, some people would be. No wonder they suspected
her when she showed such indifference. Every word
she says makes me regret more and more that I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
acknowledged her. But how was I to know? She was ill, and
made me feel as if a ghost had come before me. I
couldn&#8217;t sleep till I had made up my mind to take the
risk of her. Max sung her praises as if she was some
rare untrained genius. Nothing gave me an idea that
she would turn out this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;This way&#8217; has not damaged you much so far,&#8221; remarked
Mr. Seldon, dryly. &#8220;And as she is not likely
to be much of a charge on your hands, you had better
not borrow trouble on that score.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All very well&mdash;all very well for you to be indifferent,&#8221;
returned Mr. Haydon, with some impatience. &#8220;You have
no family to consider, no matter what wild escapade she
would be guilty of, you would not be touched by the
disgrace of it, because she doesn&#8217;t belong in any way to
your family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she will, though,&#8221; suggested Seldon.</p>
<p>Mr. Haydon shrugged his shoulders significantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean through Max, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;Yes, I was simple enough to build on that myself&mdash;thought
what a nice, quiet way it would be of arranging
the whole affair; but after a talk with this ranger, Overton,
whom you and Max unite in admiring, I concluded
he might be in the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Overton? Nonsense!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe; but he made himself very autocratic
when I attempted to discuss her future. He seemed
to show a good deal of authority concerning her affairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit more than he does over the affairs of their
paralyzed partner in there,&#8221; answered Seldon. &#8220;If she
always makes as square friends as Dan Overton, I shan&#8217;t
quarrel with her judgment.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></p>
<p>When &#8217;Tana left them and went into the other cabin,
she stood looking at Harris a long time in a curious,
scrutinizing way, and his face changed from doubt to
dread before she spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am hardly able to think any more, Joe,&#8221; she said
at last, and her tired eyes accented the truth of her
words; &#8220;but something like a thought keeps hammering
in my head about you&mdash;about you and&mdash;&#8221; She pointed
to the next room. &#8220;If you could walk, I should know
you did it. If you could talk, I should know you had
it done. I wouldn&#8217;t tell on you; but I&#8217;d be glad I was
going where I would not see you, for I never could
touch your hand again. I am going away, Joe; won&#8217;t
you tell me true whether you know who did it? Do
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head with his eyes closed. He, too,
looked pale and worn, and noticing it, she asked if he
would not rather move to some other dwelling, since&mdash;</p>
<p>He nodded his head with a sort of eagerness. All of
the two days and the night he had sat there, with only
the folds of a blanket to separate him from the room
where his dead foe lay.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will speak to them about it right away.&#8221; She lifted
his hand and stroked it with a sort of sympathy. &#8220;Joe,
can you forgive him now?&#8221; she whispered.</p>
<p>He made her no reply; only closed his eyes as before.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t, then? and I can&#8217;t ask you to, though I
suppose I ought to. Margaret would,&#8221; and she smiled
strangely. &#8220;You don&#8217;t know Margaret, do you? Well,
neither do I. But I guess she is the sort of girl I ought
to be. Joe, I can&#8217;t stay in camp any longer. Maybe I&#8217;ll
leave for the Ferry to-day. Will you miss me? Yes, I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
know you will,&#8221; she added, &#8220;and I will miss you, too.
Do you know&mdash;can you tell when Dan will come back?&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head, and an hour later she said to Max:</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me away from here, back to the Ferry&mdash;any
place. Mrs. Huzzard will, maybe, come for a few days&mdash;or
Miss Slocum. Ask them, and let me go soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>And an hour after they had started, another canoe
went slowly over the water toward the Kootenai River,
a canoe guided by Akkomi; and in it lay the blanket-draped
figure of the man whose death was yet a mystery
to the camp. He was at least borne to his resting place
by a friend, though what the reason for Akkomi&#8217;s faithfulness,
no one ever knew; for some favor in the past,
no doubt. Seldon knew that &#8217;Tana would rather Akkomi
should be the one to cover his grave, though where
it was made, no white man ever knew.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>
<h3>ON MANHATTAN ISLAND.</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What do you intend to make of your life, Montana,
since you avoid all questions of marriage? You will not
go to school, and care nothing about fitting yourself
for the society where by right you should belong.&#8221;</p>
<p>A whole winter had gone, and the springtime had
come again; and over all the Island of Manhattan,
and on the heights back from the rivers, the green of
the leaves was creeping over the boughs from which
winter had swept all signs of life months ago.</p>
<p>In a very lovely little room, facing a park where the
glitter of a tiny lake could be seen, &#8217;Tana lounged and
stared at the waving branches and the fettered water.</p>
<p>Not just the same &#8217;Tana as when, a year ago, she
had breasted the cold waves of the Kootenai. No one,
to look at her now, would connect the taller, stylishly
dressed figure, with that little half-savage who had
scowled at Overton in the lodge of Akkomi. Her hair
was no longer short and boyish in its arrangement. A
silver comb held it in place, except where the tiny curls
crept down to cluster about her neck. A gown of soft
white wool was caught at her waist by a flat woven belt
of silver, and an embroidered shoe of silvery gleam
peeped from under the white folds.</p>
<p>No, it was not the same &#8217;Tana. And the little gray-haired
lady, who slipped ivory knitting needles in and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
out of silky flosses, watched her with troubled concern
as she asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;And what do you intend to make of your life, Montana?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are out of patience with me, are you not, Miss
Seldon?&#8221; asked the girl. &#8220;Oh, yes, I know you are; and
I don&#8217;t blame you. Everything I have ever wanted in
my life is in reach of me here&mdash;everything a girl should
have; yet it doesn&#8217;t mean so much to me as I thought it
would.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you would go to school, perhaps&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I would learn to appreciate all this,&#8221; and
the girl glanced around at the fine fittings of the room,
and then back to the point of her own slipper.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I do study hard at home. Doesn&#8217;t Miss Ackerman
give me credit for learning very quickly? and doesn&#8217;t
that music teacher hop around and wave his hands over
my most excellent, ringing voice? They say I study
well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes; you do, too. But at a school, my dear,
where you would have the association of other girls,
you would naturally grow more&mdash;more girlish yourself,
if I may say so; for you are old beyond your years in
ways that are peculiar. Your ideas of things are not
the ideas of girlhood; and yet you are very fond of girls.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And how do you know that?&#8221; asked &#8217;Tana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, my dear, you never go past one on the street
that you don&#8217;t give her more notice than the very handsomest
man you might see. And at the matinees, if the
play does not hold you very close, your eyes are always
directed to the young girls in the audience. Yes, you are
fond of them, yet you will not allow yourself to be intimate
with any.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></p>
<p>And the pretty, refined-looking lady smiled at her
and nodded her head in a knowing way, as though she
had made an important discovery.</p>
<p>The girl on the couch lay silent for a while, then she
rose and went over to the window, gazing across to the
park, where people were walking and riding along the
green knolls and levels. Young girls were there, too,
and she watched them a little while, with the old moody
expression in her dark eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is because I don&#8217;t like to make friends
under false pretenses,&#8221; she said, at last. &#8220;Your society
is a very fine and very curious thing, and there is a
great deal of false pretense about it. Individually, they
would overlook the fact that I was accused of murder in
Idaho&mdash;the gold mine would help some of them to do
that! But if it should ever get in their papers here,
they would collectively think it their duty to each other
not to recognize me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Montana, my dear child, why do you not forget
that horrible life, and leave your mind free to partake
of the advantages now surrounding you?&#8221; and Miss
Seldon sighed with real distress, and dropped her ivory
needles despairingly. &#8220;It seems so strange that you care
to remember that which was surely a terrible life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much more so than you can know,&#8221; answered the
girl, coming over to her and drawing a velvet hassock
to her side. &#8220;And, my dear, good, innocent little lady,
just so long as you all try to persuade me that I should
go out among young people of my own age, just so long
must I be forced to think of how different my life has
been to theirs. Some day they, too, might learn how
different it has been, and resent my presence among them.
I prefer not to run that risk. I might get to like some
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
of them, and then it would hurt. Besides, the more I
see of people since I came here, the more I feel that
every one should remain with their own class in life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Montana, that is not an American sentiment
at all!&#8221; said Miss Seldon, with some surprise. &#8220;But
even that idea should not exclude from refined circles.
By birth you are a lady.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl smiled bitterly. &#8220;You mean my mother was,&#8221;
she answered. &#8220;But she did not give me a gentleman for
a father; and I don&#8217;t believe the parents of any of those
lovely girls we meet would like them to know the
daughter of such a man, if they knew it. Now, do you
understand how I feel about myself and this social question?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are foolishly conscientious and morbid,&#8221; exclaimed
the older lady. &#8220;I declare, Montana, I don&#8217;t
know what to do with you. People like you&mdash;you are
very clever, you have youth, wealth, and beauty&mdash;yes,
the last, too! yet you shut yourself up here like a young
nun. Only the theaters and the art galleries will you
visit&mdash;never a person&mdash;not even Margaret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even Margaret,&#8221; repeated the girl; &#8220;and that is
the crowning sin in your eyes, isn&#8217;t it? Well, I don&#8217;t
blame you, for she is very lovely; and how much she
thinks of you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221; sighed the little lady. &#8220;Mrs. Haydon is a
woman of very decided character, but not at all given
to loving demonstrations to children. Long ago, when
we lived closer, little Margie would come to me daily
to be kissed and petted. Max was only a boy then, and
they were great companions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and if he had been sensible, he would have
fallen in love with her and made her Mrs. Lyster,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
instead of knocking around Western mining towns, and
making queer friends,&#8221; said the girl, smiling at the old
lady&#8217;s astonished face. &#8220;She is just the sort of girl to
suit him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; she said, solemnly, &#8220;do you really care for
him a particle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;Max? Of course I do. He is the best fellow
I know, and was so good to me out there in the
wilderness. There was no one out there to compare me
with, so I suppose I loomed up big when compared with
the average squaw. But everything is different here.
I did not know how different. I know now, however,
and I won&#8217;t let him go on making a mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Montana!&#8221; cried the little lady, pleadingly.</p>
<p>Just then a maid entered with two cards, at which she
glanced with a dismay that was comical.</p>
<p>&#8220;Margaret and Max! Why, is it not strange they
should call at the same time, and at a time when&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was pairing them off so nicely, without their
knowledge,&#8221; added the girl. &#8220;Have them come up here,
won&#8217;t you? It is so much more cozy than that very elegant
parlor. And I always feel as if poor Max had
been turned out of his home since I came.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they came to the little sitting room&mdash;pretty, dark-eyed
Margaret, with her faultless manners and her real
fondness for Miss Seldon, whom she kissed three times.</p>
<p>&#8220;For I have not seen you for three days,&#8221; she explained,
&#8220;and those two are back numbers.&#8221; Then she
turned to &#8217;Tana and eyed her admiringly as they clasped
hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look as though you had stepped from a picture
of classic Greek,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;Where in that pretty
curly head of yours do you find the ideas for those
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
artistic arrangements of form and color? You are an
artist, Montana, and you don&#8217;t know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will begin to believe it if people keep telling me so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who else has told you?&#8221; asked Lyster, and she
laughed at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not you,&#8221; she replied; &#8220;at least not since you teased
me about the clay Indians I made on the shores of the
Kootenai. But some one else has told me&mdash;Mr. Roden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roden, the sculptor! But how does he know?&#8221;</p>
<p>She glanced from one face to the other, and sighed
with a serio-comic expression. &#8220;I might as well confess,&#8221;
she said, at last. &#8220;I am so glad you are here, Miss
Margaret, for I may need an advocate. I have been
working two hours a day in Mr. Roden&#8217;s studio for over
a month.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Montana!&#8221; gasped Miss Seldon, &#8220;but&mdash;how&mdash;when?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Before you were awake in the morning,&#8221; she said,
and looked from one to the other of their blank faces.
&#8220;You look as if it were a shock, instead of a surprise,&#8221;
she added. &#8220;I did not tell you at first, as it would seem
only a whim. But he has told me I have reason for the
whim, and that I should continue. So&mdash;I think I shall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my child&mdash;for you are a child, after all&mdash;don&#8217;t
you know it is a very strange thing for a girl to go
alone like that, and&mdash;and&mdash;Oh, dear! Max, can&#8217;t you
tell her?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Max did not. There was a slight wrinkle between
his brows, but she saw it and smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t scold me, though, can you?&#8221; she asked.
&#8220;That is right, for it would be no use. I know you would
say that in your set it would not be proper for a girl to
do such independent things. But you see, I do not belong
to any set. I have just been telling this dear little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
lady, who is trying to look stern, some of the reasons
why society life and I can never agree. But I have
found several reasons why Art life and I should agree
perfectly. I like the freedom of it&mdash;the study of it.
And, even if I never accomplish much, I shall at least
have tried my best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Montana, it is not as though you had to learn
such things,&#8221; pleaded Miss Seldon. &#8220;You have plenty
of money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, money&mdash;money! But I have found there are a
few things in this world money can not buy. Art study,
little as I have attempted, has taught me that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lyster came over and sat beside her by the window.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana,&#8221; he said, and looked at her with kindly
directness, &#8220;can the Art study give you that which you
crave, and which money can not buy?&#8221;</p>
<p>Her eyes fell to the floor. She could not but feel
sorry to go against his wishes; and yet&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it can not, entirely,&#8221; she said, at last. &#8220;But it
is all the substitute I know of, and, maybe, after a
while, it will satisfy me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Seldon took Margaret from the room on some
pretext, and Lyster rose and walked across to the other
window. He was evidently much troubled or annoyed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you are not satisfied?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;The life that
seemed possible to you, when out there in camp, is impossible
to you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Max! don&#8217;t be angry&mdash;don&#8217;t. Everything was
all wrong out there. You were sorry for me out there;
you thought me different from what I am. I could
never be the sort of girl you should marry&mdash;not like
Margaret&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Margaret!&#8221; and his face paled a little, &#8220;why do you
speak of her?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, if you do not, Max,&#8221; she answered, and
smiled at him. &#8220;I have learned several things since I
came here, and one of them is Mr. Haydon&#8217;s reason for
encouraging our friendship so much. It was to end any
attachment between you and Margaret. Oh, I know,
Max! If I had not looked just a little bit like her, you
would never have fancied you loved me&mdash;for it was only
a fancy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was no fancy! I did love you. I was honest with
you, and I have waited patiently, while you have grown
more and more distant until now&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now we had better end it all, Max. I could not make
you happy, for I am not happy myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you can not help me; and it is not your fault.
You have been good to me&mdash;very good; but I can&#8217;t
marry any one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No one?&#8221; he asked, looking at her doubtfully.
&#8220;&#8217;Tana, sometimes I have fancied you might have cared
for some one else&mdash;some one before you met me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I cared for no one before I met you,&#8221; she
answered, slowly. &#8220;But I could not be happy in the
social life of your people here. They are charming, but
I am not suited to their life. And&mdash;and I can&#8217;t go back
to the hills. So, in a month, I am going to Italy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have it all decided, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All&mdash;don&#8217;t be angry, Max. You will thank me for it
some day, though I know our friends will think badly
of me just now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they shall not; you are breaking no promises.
You took me only on trial, and it seems I don&#8217;t suit,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
he said, with a grimace. &#8220;I will see that you are not
blamed. And so long as you do not leave America, I
should like you to remain here. Don&#8217;t let anything be
changed in our friendship, &#8217;Tana.&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned to him with tears in her eyes, and held out
her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are too good to me, Max,&#8221; she said, brokenly,
&#8220;God knows what will become of me when I leave you
all and go among foreign faces, among whom I shall not
have a friend. I hope to work and&mdash;be contented; but
I shall never meet a friend like you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew her to him quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go!&#8221; he whispered, pleadingly. &#8220;I can&#8217;t let
you go out into the world alone like that! I will love
you&mdash;care for you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; and she put her hand on his face to push it
away; &#8220;it is no use, and don&#8217;t do that&mdash;try to kiss me;
you must not. No man has ever kissed me, and you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be the first,&#8221; he added, shrugging his
shoulders. &#8220;Well, I confess I hoped to be, and you are
a greater temptation than you know, Miss Montana.
And you ought to pardon me the attempt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her face was flushed and shamed. &#8220;I could pardon
a great deal in you, Max,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;but don&#8217;t
speak of it again. Talk to me of other things.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Other things? Well, I haven&#8217;t many other things in
my mind just now. Still, I did see some one down town
this morning whom you rather liked, and who asked
after you. It was Mr. Harvey, the writer, whom we
met first at Bonner&#8217;s Ferry, up in the Kootenai land.
Do you remember him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. We met him afterward at one of the art
galleries, and I have seen him several times at Roden&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
studio. They are great friends. He looked surprised
to find me there, but, after I spoke to him, he talked to
me a great deal. You know, Max, I always imagine he
heard that suspicion of me up at the camp. Do you think
so?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He never intimated it to me,&#8221; answered Max; &#8220;though
Haydon nearly went into spasms of fear lest he would
put it all in some paper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember. He would scarcely allow me breathing
space for fear the stranger would get near enough to
speak to me again. I remember all that journey, because
when I reached the end of it, the past seemed like
a troubled dream, for this life of fineness and beauty
and leisure was all so different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet you are not contented?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t talk of that&mdash;of me!&#8221; she begged. &#8220;I am
tired of myself. I just remembered another one on the
train that journey&mdash;the little variety actress who had her
dresses made to look cute and babyish&mdash;the one with
bleached hair, and they called her Goldie. She looked
scared to death when he&mdash;Overton&mdash;stopped at the window
to say good-by. I often wondered why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you know Dan was a sort of sheriff, or law-and-order
man, up there. He might have known her
unfavorably, and she was afraid of being identified by
him, or something of that sort. She belonged to the
rougher element, no doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Max, it makes me homesick to think of that country,&#8221;
she confessed. &#8220;Ever since the grass has commenced
to be green, and the buds to swell, it seems to me all the
woods are calling me. All the sluggish water I see
here in the parks and the rivers makes me dream of
the rush of the clear Kootenai, and long for a canoe and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
paddle. Contrive something to make me forget it, won&#8217;t
you? Make up a party to go somewhere&mdash;anywhere.
I will be cavalier to your lovely little aunt, and leave you
to Margaret.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I asked you before why you speak of Margaret and
me in that tone?&#8221; he said. &#8220;Are you going to tell me?
You have no reason but your own fancy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t I? Well, this isn&#8217;t fancy, Max&mdash;that I
would like to see my cousin&mdash;you see, I claim them for
this once&mdash;happy in her own way, instead of unhappy
in the life her ambitious family are trying to arrange for
her. And I promise to trade some surplus dust for a
wedding present just as soon as you conclude to spoil
their plans, and make yourself and that little girl and
your aunt all happy by a few easily spoken words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I have just told you I love you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will know better some day,&#8221; she said, and turned
away. &#8220;Now go and pacify your aunt, won&#8217;t you? She
seemed so troubled about the modeling&mdash;bless her dear
heart! I didn&#8217;t want to trouble her, but the work&mdash;some
work&mdash;was a necessity to me. I was growing so
homesick for the woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>After she was left alone, she drew a letter from her
pocket, one she had got in the morning mail, and read
over again the irregular lines sent by Mrs. Huzzard.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;I got Lavina to write you the letter at Christmas,
because I was so tickled with all the things you sent me
that I couldn&#8217;t write a straight line to save me; and you
know the rheumatiz in my finger makes it hard work
for me sometimes. But maybe hard work and me is
about done with each other, &#8217;Tana; though I&#8217;ll tell you
more of that next time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must tell you Mr. Harris has got better&mdash;can talk
some and walk around; can&#8217;t move his left arm any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
yet. But Mr. Dan sent for two fine doctors, and they
tried to help him with electricity. And I was scared for
fear lightning might strike camp after that; but it didn&#8217;t.
Lavina is here still, and likely to stay. She&#8217;s a heap of
company; and she and Captain Leek are better friends
than they was.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a new man in camp now; he found a silver
mine down near Bonner&#8217;s Ferry, and sold it out well.
He was a farmer back in Indiana, and has been on a
visit to our camp twice. Mr. Dan says it&#8217;s my cooking
fetches him. Everything is different here now. Mr.
Dan got sawed lumber, and put me up a nice little house;
and up above the bluff he has laid out a place where he
is going to build a stone house, just as if he intends to
live and die here. He doesn&#8217;t ever seem to think that
he has enough made now to rest all his days. Sometimes
I think he ain&#8217;t well. Sometimes, &#8217;Tana, I think it
would cheer him up if you would just write him a few
lines from time to time. He always says, &#8216;Is she well?&#8217;
when I get a letter from you; and about the time I&#8217;m
looking for your letters he&#8217;s mighty regular about getting
the mail here.</p>
<p>&#8220;That old Akkomi went south when winter set in, and
we reckon he&#8217;ll be back when the leaves get green. His
whole village was drunk for days on the money you had
Mr. Seldon give him, and he wore pink feathers from
some millinery store the last time I saw him. But Mr.
Dan is always patient with him whether he is drunk or
sober.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s all the news. Lavina sends her
respects. And I must tell you that on Christmas they
got some whisky, and all the boys drank your health&mdash;and
drank it so often Mr. Dan had to give them a talking
to. They think a heap of you. Yours with affection,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<h3>OVERTON&#8217;S WIFE.</h3>
</div>

<p>A few hours later, &#8217;Tana sat in a box at the theater;
for the party she had suggested had been arranged, and
pretty Miss Margaret was radiant over the evening
planned for her, and &#8217;Tana began to enjoy her rôle of
matchmaker. She had even managed to tell Margaret,
in a casual manner, that Miss Seldon&#8217;s idea of a decided
engagement between herself and Max had never a very
solid foundation, and now had none at all. He was her
good friend&mdash;that was all, and she was to leave for Italy
in a month.</p>
<p>And Margaret went up to her and kissed her, looking
at her with puzzled, admiring eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;They tried at home to make me think very differently,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;But you are a queer girl, Miss Montana.
You have told me this on purpose, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I want to hear over in Italy that you are going
to make a boy I like very happy some of these days.
Remember, Margaret, you are&mdash;or will be&mdash;a millionairess,
while he has not more than a comfortable income;
and boys&mdash;even when they are in love&mdash;can be
proud. Will you think of that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Margaret only blushed and turned away, but the
answer was quite satisfying to &#8217;Tana, and she felt freer
because her determination had been put into words, and
the last bond connecting her with the old life was to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
broken. Ever since the snows had gone, some cord of
her heart-string had been drawing all her thoughts to
those Northern hills, and she felt the only safety was to
put the ocean between them and her.</p>
<p>The home Mr. Seldon had offered her with his sister
was a very lovely one, but to it there came each week
letters about the mines and the people there. Mr. Seldon
had already gone out, and would be gone all summer. As
he was an enthusiast over the beauties and the returns of
the country, his letters were full of material that she
heard discussed each day. Therefore, the only safety
for herself lay in flight; and if she did not go across the
ocean to the East, she would surely grow weaker and
more homesick until she would have to turn coward entirely
and cross the mountains to her West.</p>
<p>Realizing it all, she sat in her dainty array of evening
dress and watched with thoughts far away the mimic
scene of love triumphant on the stage before her. When,
on the painted canvas, a far-off snow-crowned mountain
rose to their view, her heart seemed to creep to her throat
and choke her, and when the orchestra breathed softly
of the winds, music, and the twittering of birds, the tears
rose to her eyes and a great longing in her heart for all
the wild beauty of her Kootenai land.</p>
<p>Then, just as the curtain went down on the second
act, some one entered their box.</p>
<p>&#8220;You, Harvey?&#8221; said Max, with genuine pleasure.
&#8220;Good of you to look me up. Let me introduce you to
my aunt and Miss Haydon. You and Miss Rivers are
old acquaintances.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; and that fact alone has brought me here just
now,&#8221; he managed to say to Lyster. &#8220;To confess the
truth, I have been to see Miss Rivers at her home this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
evening, having got her address from Roden, and then
had the assurance to follow her here. You may be sure
I would not have spoiled your evening for any trivial
thing, but I come because of a woman who is dying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A woman who is dying?&#8221; repeated &#8217;Tana, in wonder.
&#8220;And why do you come to me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She wants to see you. I think&mdash;to tell you something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But who is it?&#8221; asked Lyster. &#8220;Some beggar?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a beggar now at least,&#8221; agreed Mr. Harvey&mdash;&#8220;a
poor woman dying. She said only to tell Miss Rivers,
and here is a line she sent.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave her a slip of paper, and on it was written:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Come and take some word to Dan Overton for me. I
am dying.</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Overton&#8217;s wife.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>She arose, and Margaret exclaimed at the whiteness
of her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear,&#8221; sighed Miss Seldon, &#8220;you know how
I warned you not to give your charities individually
among the beggars of a city. It is really a mistake.
They have no consideration, and will send for you at all
hours if you will go. It is so much better to distribute
charity through some organization.&#8221;</p>
<p>But &#8217;Tana was tying her opera cloak, and moving
toward the entrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. Is it far, Mr.
Harvey? If not, perhaps I can be back to go home with
you when the curtain goes down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not far,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Will you come, Lyster?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said &#8217;Tana; &#8220;you stay with the others, Max.
Don&#8217;t look vexed. Maybe I can be of some use, and
that is what I need.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many heads turned to look at the girl whose laces
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
were so elegant, and whose beautiful face wore such a
startled, questioning expression. But she hurried out of
their sight, and gave a little nervous shiver as she
wrapped her white velvet cloak close about her and sank
into a corner of the carriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you cold?&#8221; Harvey asked, but she shook her
head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. But tell me all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is not much. I was with a doctor&mdash;a friend of
mine&mdash;who was called in to see her. She recognized
me. It is the little variety actress who came over the
Great Northern, on our train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! But how could she know me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She did not know your name; she only described you,
remembering that I had talked with you and your friends.
When I told her you were in the city, she begged so for
you to come that I could not refuse to try.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You did right,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;But it is very
strange&mdash;very strange.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then the carriage stopped before a dingy house in
a row that had once belonged to a very fashionable
quarter, but that was long ago. Boarding houses they
were now, and their class was about number three.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a horrible place to bring you to, Miss Rivers,&#8221;
confessed her guide; &#8220;and I am really glad Miss Seldon
did not accompany you, for she never would have forgiven
either of us. But I knew you would not be afraid.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I am not afraid. But, oh, why don&#8217;t they hurry?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had to ring the bell the second time ere any one
came to the door. Then, as the harsh jangle died away,
steps were heard descending the stairs, and a man without
a coat and with a pipe in his mouth, shot back the
bolt with much grumbling.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll cut the blasted wire if some one in the shebang
don&#8217;t tend to this door better,&#8221; he growled to a lady
with a mug of beer, who just then emerged from the
lower regions. &#8220;Me a-trying to get the lines of that
new afterpiece in my head&mdash;chock-full of business, too!&mdash;and
that bell clanging forever right under my room.
I&#8217;ll move!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you would,&#8221; remarked Harvey, when the door
opened at last. &#8220;Move a little faster when you do condescend
to open the door. Come, Miss Rivers&mdash;up
this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the lady of the beer mug and the gentleman of
the pipe stared at each other, and at the white vision of
girlhood going up the dark, bad-smelling stairway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a new sort in this castle,&#8221; remarked the
man. &#8220;Do you guess the riddle of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman did not answer, but listened to the footsteps
as they went along the hall. Then a door opened
and shut.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve gone to Goldie&#8217;s room,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s
queer. Goldie ain&#8217;t the sort to have very high-toned
friends, so it can&#8217;t be a long-lost sister,&#8221; and she smiled
contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a beauty, anyway, and I&#8217;m going to see her
when she makes her exit, if I have to sit up all night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! And what about the afterpiece?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the devil with the afterpiece! It hasn&#8217;t any angels
in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Inside Goldie&#8217;s room, a big Dutch blonde in a soiled
blue wrapper sat by the bed, and stared in open-mouthed
surprise at the new-comers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it <i>you</i> she&#8217;s been askin&#8217; for?&#8221; she asked, bluntly.</p>
<p>But &#8217;Tana did not reply, and Harvey got the blonde
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
to the door, and after a few whispered words, induced
her to go out altogether, and closed the door behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d come,&#8221; whispered the little woman
on the bed. &#8220;I thought the note would bring you. I
saw you talk to him, and I dropped to the game. You&#8217;re
square, too, ain&#8217;t you? That&#8217;s the kind I want now.
That swell who went for you is the right sort, too. I
minded his face and yours. But tell him to go out for
a minute. It won&#8217;t take long&mdash;to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harvey went, at a motion from &#8217;Tana. She had not
uttered a word yet. All she could do was to stare in
wonder at the wreck of a woman before her&mdash;a painted
wreck; for, even on her deathbed, the ghastly face was
tinted with rouge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get well&mdash;doctor says,&#8221; she continued. &#8220;There
was a baby; it died yesterday&mdash;three hours old; and I
can&#8217;t get well. But there is another one I want to tell
you of. You tell him. It is two years old. Here is
the address. Maybe he will take care of it for me. He
was good-hearted&mdash;that&#8217;s why he married me; thought
I was only a little girl without a home. Any woman
could fool him, for he thought all women were good.
He thought I was only a little girl; and I had been
married three years before.&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled at the idea of that past deception, while
&#8217;Tana&#8217;s face grew hard and white.</p>
<p>&#8220;How you look!&#8221; said the dying woman. &#8220;Well, it&#8217;s
over now. He never cared for me much, though&mdash;not
so much as others did. He was never my real husband,
you know, for I never had a divorce. He thought he
was, though; and even after he left me, he sent me
money regular for me to live quiet in &#8217;Frisco, but it
didn&#8217;t suit me. Then he got turned dead against me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
when I tried to make him think the child was his. He
wouldn&#8217;t do anything for me after that; I had cheated
him once too often.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And was it?&#8221; It was the first time &#8217;Tana had spoken,
and the woman smiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;You care, too, do you? Well, yes, it was. You tell
him so; tell him I said so, and I was dying. He&#8217;ll take
care of her, I think. She&#8217;s pretty, but not like me. He
never saw her. She&#8217;s with a woman in Chicago, where
I boarded. I haven&#8217;t paid her board now for months, but
it&#8217;s all right; the woman&#8217;s a good soul. Dan Overton
will pay when you tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You write an order for that child, and tell the woman
to give it to me,&#8221; said &#8217;Tana, decidedly, and looked around
for something to write with. A sheet of paper was
found, and she went to Harvey for a pencil.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Most ready to go?&#8221; he asked, looking at her
anxiously.</p>
<p>She nodded her head, and shut the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can&#8217;t write now; my hands are too weak,&#8221; complained
the woman. &#8220;I can&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve <i>got</i> to!&#8221; answered the girl; and, taking her
in her strong young hands, she raised her up higher on
the pillow. &#8220;There is the paper and pencil&mdash;now write.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will kill me to lay like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter if it does; you write.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not a woman at all; you&#8217;re like iron&mdash;white
iron,&#8221; whined the other. &#8220;Any woman with a heart&mdash;&#8221;
and the weak tears came in her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I have no heart to be touched by you,&#8221; answered
the girl. &#8220;You had a chance to live a decent life, and
you wouldn&#8217;t take it. You had an honest man to trust
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
you and take care of you, and you paid him with deceit.
Don&#8217;t expect pity from me; but write that order.&#8221;</p>
<p>She tried to write but could not, and the girl took the
pencil.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will write it, and you can sign it,&#8221; she said; &#8220;that
will do as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus it was accomplished, and the woman was again
laid lower in the bed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are terrible hard on&mdash;on folks that ain&#8217;t just
square,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t be so proud; you ain&#8217;t
dead yet yourself. You don&#8217;t know what may happen to
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said the girl, coldly, &#8220;that if I ever brought
children into the world, to be thrown on strangers&#8217; hands
and brought up in the streets to live your sort of life, I
would expect a very practical sort of hell prepared for
me. Have you anything more to tell me? I&#8217;m going.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;h! I wish you hadn&#8217;t said that about hell. I&#8217;m
dreadful afraid of hell,&#8221; moaned the woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the girl; &#8220;you ought to be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How hard you are! And the doctor said I would die
to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she lay still quite a while, and when she spoke
again, her voice seemed weaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have that order for Gracie, and you are so hard-hearted.
I don&#8217;t know what you will do&mdash;and I don&#8217;t
want her to grow up like me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the first womanly thing I have heard you say,&#8221;
replied the girl.</p>
<p>She went over to the bed and took the woman&#8217;s hands
in hers, looking at her earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your child shall have a beautiful and a good home,&#8221;
she said, reassuringly. &#8220;I am going for her myself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
to-morrow, and she will never lack care again. Have you
any other word to give me?&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman shook her head, and then as &#8217;Tana turned
away, she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless you would kiss me. You are not like
other women; but&mdash;will you kiss me?&#8221;</p>
<p>And, with the pressure of the dying kiss on her lips,
&#8217;Tana went out the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please give her every care money can secure for her,&#8221;
she said to the woman at the door; while the man, minus
the pipe, was there to open it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Harvey, can I trouble you to look after it for
me? You know the doctor and can learn all that is
needed. Have the bills sent to me; and let me know when
it is all&mdash;over.&#8221;</p>
<p>They reached the theater just as the curtain went
down on the last act, and she remained in the carriage
until her own party came out.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can hardly thank you enough for coming after me
to-night,&#8221; she said, as she shook hands very cordially
with Harvey. &#8220;You can never be a mere acquaintance
to me again. You are my friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have I ignorantly done some good?&#8221; he asked, and
she smiled at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;more than you know&mdash;more than I can tell
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then may I hope not to be forgotten when you are
in Italy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; and the color flushed over all the pallor caught
from that deathbed. &#8220;But I&mdash;I don&#8217;t think I will go
to Italy after all, Mr. Harvey. I have changed my mind
about that, and think I will go back to the Kootenai
hills instead.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<h3>LIFE AT TWIN SPRINGS.</h3>
</div>

<p>Over all the land of the Kootenai the sun of early June
was shining. Trees of wild fruits were white with blossoms,
as if from far above on the mountains the snows
had blown down and settled here and there on the new
twigs of green.</p>
<p>And high up above the camp of the Twin Springs,
Overton and Harris sat looking over the wide stretches
of forest, and the younger man looked troubled.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think your fear is all an empty affair,&#8221; he said, in
an argumentative tone. &#8220;You eat well and sleep well.
What gives you the idea you are to be called in soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Several things,&#8221; said the other, slowly, and his speech
was yet indistinct; &#8220;but most of all the feel of my feet
and legs. A week ago my feet turned cold; this week
the coldness is up to my knees, and it won&#8217;t go away. I
know what it means. When it gets as high as my heart
I&#8217;ll be done for. That won&#8217;t take long, Dan; and I
want to see her first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she can, too. You don&#8217;t know. Dan, send for
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Things are all different with her now,&#8221; protested the
other. &#8220;She&#8217;s with friends who are not of the diggings
or the ranges, Joe. She is going to marry Max Lyster;
and, altogether, is not the same little girl who made our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
coffee for us down there in the flat. You must not expect
that she will change all her new, happy life to run
back here just because you want to talk to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll come if you telegraph I want her,&#8221; insisted
Harris. &#8220;I know her better than you do, Dan. The
fine life will never spoil her. She would be happier here
to-day in a canoe than she would be on a throne. I know
her best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She wasn&#8217;t very happy before she left here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he agreed; &#8220;but there were reasons, Dan. Why
are you so set against her coming back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Set against it? Oh, no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you are. Mrs. Huzzard and all the camp would
be only too glad to see her; but you&mdash;you say no. What&#8217;s
your reason?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe, not many months ago you tried to make me suspicious
of her,&#8221; said Overton, not moving his eyes from
a distant blue peak of the hills. &#8220;You remember the day
you fell in a heap? Well, I&#8217;ve never asked you your
reasons for that; though I&#8217;ve thought of it considerably.
You changed your mind about her afterward, and trusted
her with the plan of this gold field down here. Now, you
had reasons for that, too; but I never have asked you
what they are. Do the same for me, will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The other man did not answer for a little while, but he
watched Dan&#8217;s moody face with a great deal of kindness
in his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t tell me?&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s
all right. But one of the reasons I want her back is to
make clear to you all the unexplained things of last
summer. There were things you should have been told&mdash;that
would have made you two better friends, would
have broken down the wall there always seemed to be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
between you&mdash;or nearly always. (She wouldn&#8217;t tell you,
and I couldn&#8217;t.) It left her always under a cloud to
you, and she felt it. Many a time, Dan, she has knelt
beside me and cried over her troubles to me&mdash;and they
were troubles, too!&mdash;telling them all to me just because
I couldn&#8217;t speak and tell them again. And I won&#8217;t, unless
she lets me. But I don&#8217;t want to go over the range
and know that you two, all your lives, will be apart and
cold to each other on account of suspicions I could clear
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Suspicions? No, I have no suspicions against her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you have had many a troubled hour because of
that man found dead in her room, and his visit to her the
night before, and that money she asked for that he was
after. All such things that you could not clear her of
in your own mind, when you cleared her of murder&mdash;they
are things I want straightened out before I leave,
Dan. You have both been good friends to me, and I
don&#8217;t want any bar between you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does all that matter now, Joe? She is out of
our lives, and in a happier one some one else is making
for her. I am not likely ever to see her again. She
won&#8217;t come back here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know her best; she will come if she is needed. I
need her for once; and if you don&#8217;t send for her, I will,
Dan. Will you send?&#8221;</p>
<p>But Overton got up and walked away without answering.
Harris thought he would turn back after a little
while, but he did not. He watched him out of sight,
and he was still going higher up in the hills.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trying to walk away from his desire for her,&#8221; thought
Joe, sadly. &#8220;Well, he never will. He thinks I don&#8217;t
know. Poor Dan!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></p>
<p>Then he whistled to a man down below him, and the
man came and helped him down to camp, for his feet had
grown helpless again in that strange chill of which he
had spoken.</p>
<p>Mrs. Huzzard met him at the door of a sitting room,
gorgeous as an apartment could well be in the Northern
wilderness. All the luxuries obtainable were there; for,
as Harris had to live so much of his time indoors, Overton
seemed determined that he should get benefit from his
new fortune in some way. The finest of furs and of
weavings furnished the room, and a dainty little stand
held a tea service of shell-pink china, from which the
steam floated cheerily.</p>
<p>And Lorena Jane herself partook of the general air of
prosperity, as she drew forward a great cushioned chair
for the invalid and brought him a cup of fragrant tea.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just knew you was tired the minute I saw you coming
down that hill,&#8221; she said, filling a cup herself and
sitting down to enjoy it. &#8220;I knew a cup of tea would
do you good, for you ain&#8217;t quite so brisk as you was a
few weeks ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he agreed, and gulped down the beverage with
a dubious expression on his face. He very much preferred
whisky as a tonic; but as Mrs. Huzzard was bound
to use that new tea service every day for his benefit, he
submitted without a protest and enjoyed most the number
of cups she disposed of.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose, now, you got sight from up there on the
hill of the two young folks going boat riding?&#8221; she remarked,
with attempted indifference; and he looked at
her questioningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I mean Lavina and the captain! Yes, he did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
get up ambition enough to paddle a boat and ask her to
ride in it; and away they went, giddy as you please!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you had a high regard for the captain?&#8221;
remarked Harris.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who? Me? Well, as Mr. Overton&#8217;s relation, of
course I show him respect,&#8221; and her tone was almost as
pompous as that of the captain used to be. &#8220;But I must
say, sir, that to admire a man&mdash;for me to admire a man&mdash;he
must have a certain lot of push and ambition.
He must be a real American, who don&#8217;t depend on the
record of his dead relations to tell you how great he is&mdash;a
man who will dig either gold or potatoes if he needs
them, and not be afraid of spoiling his hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody like this new lucky man, McCoy,&#8221; suggested
Harris, and she smiled complacently but did not
answer.</p>
<p>And out on the little creek, sure enough, Lavina and
the captain were gliding with the current, and the current
had got them into dangerous waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you won&#8217;t say yes, Lavina?&#8221; he asked, and she
tapped her foot impatiently on the bottom of the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;I told you yes twenty-five years ago, Alf Leek,&#8221; she
answered.</p>
<p>He sighed helplessly. His old aggressive manner was
all gone. The tactics he would adopt for any other
woman were useless with this one. She knew him like
a book. She had him completely cowed and miserable.
No longer did he regale admiring friends with tales of
the late war, and incidentally allow himself to be thought
a hero. One look from Lavina would freeze the story
of the hottest battle that ever was fought.</p>
<p>To be sure, she had as yet refrained from using words
against him; but how long would she refrain? That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
question he had asked himself until, in despair, a loop-hole
from her quiet vengeance had occurred to him, and
he had asked her to marry him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You never could&mdash;would marry any one else,&#8221; he
said, pleadingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, couldn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I couldn&#8217;t, either, Lavina,&#8221; he continued, looking
at her sentimentally. But Lavina knew better.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would, if anybody would have you,&#8221; she retorted.
&#8220;I know I reached here just in time to keep
poor Lorena Jane from being made a victim of. You
would have been a tyrant over her, with your great pretensions,
if I hadn&#8217;t stopped it. You always were tyrannical,
Alf Leek; and the only time you&#8217;re humble as you
ought to be is when you meet some one who can tyrannize
over you. You are one of the sort that needs it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why I asked you to marry me,&#8221; he remarked,
meekly.</p>
<p>And after a moment she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, thinking of it from that point of view, I guess
I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Far up on the heights, a man lying there alone saw
the canoe with the man and the woman in it, and it
brought back to him keen rushes of memory from the
summer time that had been. It was only a year ago
that &#8217;Tana had stepped into his canoe, and gone with him
to the new life of the settlement. How brave she had
been! how daring! He liked best to remember her as she
had been then, with all the storms and sunshine of her
face. He liked to remember that she had said she would
be cook for him, but for no other man. Of course her
words were a child&#8217;s words, soon forgotten by her. But
all her words and looks and their journeys made him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
love the land he had known her in. They were all the
treasures he had with which to comfort his loneliness.</p>
<p>And when in the twilight he descended to the camp,
Joe&mdash;or his own longings&mdash;had won.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will send the telegram for you, old fellow,&#8221; he said,
and that was all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<h3>AGAIN ON THE KOOTENAI.</h3>
</div>

<p>Another canoe, with a woman in it, skimmed over
the waters in the twilight that evening&mdash;a woman with
all the gladness of youth in her bright eyes, and an eagerness
for the north country that far outstripped the speed
of the boat.</p>
<p>Each dark tree-trunk as it loomed up from the shores,
each glint of the after-glow as it lighted the ripples,
each whisper of the fresh, soft wind of the mountains,
was to her as a special welcome. All of them touched
her with the sense of a friendship that had been faithful.
That she was no more to them than any of the
strangers who came and went on the current, she could
not believe; for they all meant so much, so very much
to her.</p>
<p>She asked for a paddle, that she might once more
feel against her strength the strong rush of the mountain
river. She caressed its waves and reached out
her hands to the bending boughs, and laughter and
sighs touched her lips.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never again!&#8221; she whispered, as if a promise was
being made; &#8220;never again! my wilderness!&#8221;</p>
<p>The man who had charge of the canoe&mdash;a stalwart,
red-whiskered man of perhaps forty-five&mdash;looked at her
a good deal in a cautious way. She was so unlike any
of the girls he had ever seen&mdash;so gay, so free of speech
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
with each stranger or Indian who came their way; so
daintily garbed in a very correct creation of some city
tailor; and, above all, so tenderly careful of a child who
slept among the rugs at her feet, and looked like a bit
of pink blossom against the dark furs.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a stranger here, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; she asked the
man. &#8220;I saw no one like you running a boat here last
summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; he said, slowly; &#8220;I didn&#8217;t then. My camp
is east of Bonner&#8217;s Ferry, quite a ways; but I get around
here sometimes, too. I don&#8217;t run a boat only for myself;
but when they told me a lady wanted to get to Twin
Springs, I didn&#8217;t allow no scrub Indians to take her
if my boat was good enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a lovely boat,&#8221; she said, admiringly; &#8220;the prettiest
I ever saw on this river, and it is very good of you
to bring me yourself. That is one of the things makes
me realize I am in the West once more&mdash;to be helped
simply because I am a girl alone. And you didn&#8217;t even
know my name when you offered to bring me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I did before I left shore,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;and
then I counted myself kind of lucky. I&mdash;I&#8217;ve heard so
much about you, miss, from folks up at Twin Springs;
from one lady there in particular&mdash;Mrs. Huzzard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! so you know her, do you?&#8221; she asked, and
wondered at the self-conscious look with which he
owned up that he did&mdash;a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;A little? Oh, that is not nearly enough,&#8221; she said,
good-naturedly. &#8220;Lorena Jane is worth knowing a good
deal of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my opinion, too,&#8221; he agreed; &#8220;but a fellow
needs some help sometimes, if he ain&#8217;t over handy with
the gift of gab.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, I should not think you would need much
help,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You ought to be the sort she
would make friends with quick enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;friends,&#8221; he said, and sent the canoe on
with swifter, stronger strokes. The other boat, paddled
by Indians and carrying baggage, was left far behind.</p>
<p>&#8220;You make this run often?&#8221; she asked, with a little
wonder as to who the man was. His dress was much
above the average, his boat was a beautiful and costly
thing, and she had not learned, in the haste of her departure,
who her boatman was.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very often. Haven&#8217;t been up this way for two
weeks now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that is often,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Are you located in this
country?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;yes, I have been. I struck a silver lode across
the hills in yon direction. I&#8217;ve sold out and am only
prospecting around just now, not settled anywhere yet.
My name is McCoy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;McCoy!&#8221; and like a flash she remembered the post-script
of Mrs. Huzzard&#8217;s letter. &#8220;Oh, yes&mdash;I&#8217;ve heard
of you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have? Well, that&#8217;s funny. I didn&#8217;t know my
name had got beyond the ranges.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you? Well, it got across the country to
Manhattan Island&mdash;that&#8217;s where I was when it reached
me,&#8221; and she smiled quizzically. &#8220;You know Mrs. Huzzard
writes me letters sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And do you mean&mdash;did she&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she did&mdash;mentioned your name very kindly, too,&#8221;
she said, as he hesitated in a confused way. Then, with
all the gladness of home-coming in her heart and her
desire that no heart should be left heavy, she added:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
&#8220;And, really, as I told you before, I don&#8217;t think you need
much help.&#8221;</p>
<p>The kindly, smiling eyes of the man thanked her, as
he drove the canoe through the clear waters. Above
them the stars were commencing to gleam faintly, and
all the sweet odors of the dusk floated by them, and
the sweetest seemed to come to her from the north.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will not stop over&mdash;let us go on,&#8221; she said, when
he spoke of Sinna Ferry. &#8220;I can paddle while you rest
at times, or we can float there on the current if we both
grow tired; but let us keep going.&#8221;</p>
<p>But ere they reached the little settlement, a canoe
swept into sight ahead of them and when it came near,
Captain Leek very nearly fell over the side of it in his
anxiety to make himself known to Miss Rivers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strangest thing in the world!&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Here
I am, sent down to telegraph you and wait a week if
need be until an answer comes; and half-way on my
journey I meet you just as if the message had reached
you in some way before it was even put on paper. Extraordinary
thing&mdash;very!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were going to telegraph me? What for?&#8221; and
the lightness of her heart was chased away by fear. &#8220;Is&mdash;is
any one hurt?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurt? Not a bit of it. But Harris thinks he is
worse and wanted you, until Dan concluded to ask you
to come. I have the message here somewhere,&#8221; and he
drew out a pocket-book.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dan asked me to come? Let me see it, please,&#8221; and
she unfolded the paper and read the words he had written&mdash;the
only time she had ever seen his writing in a
message to her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></p>
<p>A lighted match threw a flickering light over the
page, on which he said:</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Joe is worse. He wants you. Will you come back?</p>
<div class='ra'>
<p>&#8220;<span style='font-variant: small-caps'>Dan Overton.</span>&#8221;</p>
</div>

</div>
<p>She folded it up and held it tight in her hand under
the cloak she wore. He had sent for her! Ah! how
long the night would be, for not until dawn could she
answer his message.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will go on,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Can&#8217;t you spare us a
boatman? Mr. McCoy has outstripped our Indian extras
who have our outfit, and he needs a little rest,
though he won&#8217;t own up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course! Our errand is over, too, so we&#8217;ll
turn back with you. I just passed Akkomi a few miles
back. He is coming North with the season, as
usual. I thought the old fellow would freeze out with
the winter; but there he was drifting North to a camping-place
he wanted to reach before stopping. I suppose
we&#8217;ll have him for a neighbor all summer again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl, remembering his antipathy to all of the
red race, laughed and raised in her arms the child, that
had awakened.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I needed to perfect my return to the Kootenai
country was the presence of Akkomi,&#8221; she confessed.
&#8220;I should have missed him, for he was my first friend
in the valley. And it may be, Mr. McCoy, that if he
is inclined to be friendly to-night, I may ask him to take
me the rest of the way. I want to talk to him. He is
an old friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; agreed McCoy; but he evidently thought
her desire was a very peculiar one.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will have a friend at court just the same&mdash;whether
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
I go all the way with you or not,&#8221; she said and
smiled across at him knowingly.</p>
<p>Captain Leek heard the words, too, and must have
understood them, for he stared stonily at the big, good-looking
miner. Their greeting had been very brief;
evidently they were not congenial spirits.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a&mdash;a child?&#8221; asked the captain, as the little
creature drooped drowsily with its face against &#8217;Tana&#8217;s
neck; &#8220;really a child?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Really a child,&#8221; returned the girl, &#8220;and the sweetest,
prettiest little thing in the world when her eyes are
open.&#8221; As he continued to stare at her in astonishment
while their boats kept opposite each other, she added:
&#8220;You would have sooner expected to see me with a pet
bear, or wolf, wouldn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; I think I would,&#8221; he confessed, and she drew
the child closer and kissed it and laughed happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is because you only know one side of me,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>The stars were thick overhead, and their clear light
made the night beautiful. When they reached the boats
of Akkomi, only a short parley was held, and then an
Indian canoe darted out ahead of the others. Two dark
experts bent to the paddles and old Akkomi sat near
the girl and the child. Looking in their dusky faces,
&#8217;Tana realized more fully that she was again in the
land of the Kootenais.</p>
<p>It was just as she would have chosen to come back,
and close against her heart was pressed the message by
which he had called her.</p>
<p>The child slept, but she and the old Indian talked
now and then in low tones all through the night. She
felt no weariness. The air she breathed was as a tonic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
against fatigue, and when the canoe veered to the left
and entered the creek leading to camp, she knew her
journey was almost over.</p>
<p>The dusk was yet over the land, a faint whiteness
touched the eastern edge of the night and told of the
dawn to come, but it had not arrived.</p>
<p>The camp was wrapped in silence. Only the watch-man
of the ore-sheds was awake, and came tramping
down to the shore when their paddles dipped in the
water and told him a boat was near. It was the man
Saunders.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Rivers!&#8221; he exclaimed, incredulously. &#8220;Well,
if this isn&#8217;t luck! Harris will about drop dead with joy
when he sees you. He took worse just after dark last
night. He says he is worse, though he can talk yet. I
was with him a little while, and how he did worry because
you wouldn&#8217;t get here before he was done for!
Overton has been with him all night; went to bed only
an hour ago. I&#8217;ll call the folks up for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said the girl, hastily; &#8220;call no one yet. I will
go to Joe if you will take me. If he is so bad, that will
be best. Let the rest sleep.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can I carry the&mdash;the baby?&#8221; he asked, doubtfully,
and took the child in his arms with a sort of fear lest it
should break. He was not the sort of man to be needlessly
curious, so he showed no surprise at the rather
strange adjunct to her outfit, but carried the little sleeper
into the pretty sitting room, where he deposited it on
a couch, and the girl arranged it comfortably, that it
might at last have undisturbed rest.</p>
<p>A man in an adjoining room heard their voices and
came to the door.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can come out for a while, Kelly,&#8221; said Saunders.
&#8220;This is Miss Rivers. She will want to see him.&#8221;</p>
<p>A minute later the man in charge had left &#8217;Tana alone
beside Harris.</p>
<p>All the life in him seemed to gather in his eyes as he
looked at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have come! I told him you would&mdash;I told
Dan,&#8221; he whispered, excitedly. &#8220;Come close; turn up
the light; I want to see you plain. Just the same girl;
but happier&mdash;a heap happier, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A heap happier,&#8221; she agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;And I helped you about it some&mdash;about the mine,
I mean. I like to think of that, to think I made some
return for the harm I done you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you never did me any harm, Joe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I did&mdash;lots. You didn&#8217;t know&mdash;but I did.
That&#8217;s why I wanted you to come so bad. I wanted to
square things&mdash;before I had to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are all right, Joe. You are not going to
die. You are much better than when I saw you last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I can talk, you think so,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;But I am cold to my waist&mdash;I know what that means;
and I ain&#8217;t grumbling. It&#8217;s all right, now that you have
come. Queer that all the time we&#8217;ve known each other,
this is the first time I&#8217;ve talked to you! &#8217;Tana, you must
let me tell Dan Overton all&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All! All what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where I saw you first, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no, I can&#8217;t do that,&#8221; she said, shrinking back.
&#8220;Joe, I&#8217;ve tried often to think of it&mdash;of telling him, but
I never could. He will have to trust or distrust me,
but I can&#8217;t tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know how you feel; but you wrong yourself. Any
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
one would give you credit instead of blaming you&mdash;don&#8217;t
you ever think of that? And then&mdash;then, &#8217;Tana,
I tried to tell him down at the Ferry, because I thought
you were in some game against him. I managed to tell
him you were Holly&#8217;s partner, but hadn&#8217;t got any farther
when the paralysis caught me. I hadn&#8217;t time to tell him
that Holly was your father, and that he made you go
where he said; or that you dressed as a boy and was
called &#8217;Monte,&#8217; because that disguise was the only safety
possible for you in the gambling dens where he took
you. Part of it I didn&#8217;t understand clearly at that time.
I didn&#8217;t know you really thought he was dead, and that
you tramped alone into this region in your boy&#8217;s clothes,
so you could get a new start where no white folks knew
you. I told him just enough to wrong you in his eyes,
and then could not tell him enough to right you again.
Now do you know why I want you to let me tell him all&mdash;while
I can?&#8221;</p>
<p>It had taken him a long time to say the words; his
articulation had grown indistinct at times, and the excitement
was wearing on him.</p>
<p>Once the door into the room where the child lay swung
open noiselessly, and he had turned his eyes in that
direction; but the girl&#8217;s head was bowed on the arm of
his chair, and she did not notice it.</p>
<p>&#8220;And then&mdash;there are other things,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;He don&#8217;t know you were the boy Fannie spoke of in
that letter; or that she gave you the plot of this land;
or, more&mdash;far more to me!&mdash;that you took care of her
till she died. All that must give him many a worried
thought, &#8217;Tana, that you never counted on, for he liked
you&mdash;and yet all along he has been made to think wrong
of you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; she assented. &#8220;He blamed me for&mdash;for a
man being in my cabin that night, and I&mdash;I wanted him
to&mdash;think well of me; but I could not tell him the truth,
I was ashamed of it all my life. And the shame has got
in my blood till I can&#8217;t change it. I want him to know,
but I can&#8217;t tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to,&#8221; said a voice back of her, and she
arose to see Overton standing in the door. &#8220;I did not
mean to listen; but I stopped to look at the child, and
I heard. I hope you are not sorry,&#8221; and he came over to
her with outstretched hand.</p>
<p>She could not speak at first. She had dreamed of so
many ways in which she would meet him&mdash;of what she
would say to him; and now she stood before him without
a word.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be sorry, &#8217;Tana,&#8221; he said, and tightened his
hand over her own. &#8220;I honor you for what I heard just
now. You were wrong not to tell me; I might have
saved you some troubles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was ashamed&mdash;ashamed!&#8221; she said, and turned
away.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is not to me all this should be told,&#8221; he said,
more coldly. &#8220;Max is the one to know; or, maybe, he
does know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He knows a little&mdash;not much. Seldon and Haydon
recognized&mdash;Holly. So the family knew that, but no
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was so hard for her to talk to him there, where
Harris looked from one to the other expectantly.</p>
<p>And then the child slipped from the couch and came
toddling into the light and to the girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tana&mdash;bek-fas!&#8221; she lisped, imperatively. &#8220;Bek-fas.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you shall have your breakfast very soon,&#8221;
promised the girl. &#8220;But come and shake hands with
these gentlemen.&#8221;</p>
<p>She surveyed them each with baby scrutiny, and refused.
&#8220;Bek-fas&#8221; was all the world contained that she
would give attention to just then.</p>
<p>&#8220;You with a baby, &#8217;Tana?&#8221; said Harris. &#8220;Have you
adopted one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite,&#8221; and she wished&mdash;how she wished it was
all over! &#8220;Her mother, who is dead, gave her to me.
But she has a father. I have come up here to see what
he will say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Up here!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But I must go and find some one to get her
breakfast. Then&mdash;Dan&mdash;I would like to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bowed and started to follow her, but Harris called
him back.</p>
<p>&#8220;This spurt of strength has about done for me,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;The cold is creeping up fast. I want to tell you
something else. Don&#8217;t tell her till I am gone, for she
wouldn&#8217;t touch my hand if she knew it. I killed Lee
Holly!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t&mdash;you couldn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did. I was able to walk long before you knew it,
but I lay low. I knew if he was living, he would come
where she was, sooner or later, and I knew the gold
would fetch him, so I waited. I could hardly keep from
killing him as he left her cabin that first night, but she
had told him to come back, and I knew that would be
my time. She thought once it might be me, but changed
her mind. Don&#8217;t tell her till I am gone, Dan. And&mdash;listen!
You are everything to her, and you don&#8217;t know
it. I knew it before she left, but&mdash;Oh, well, it&#8217;s all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
square now, I guess. She won&#8217;t blame me&mdash;after I&#8217;m
dead. She knows he deserved it. She knew I meant
to kill him, if ever I was able.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know? He was the man&mdash;my partner&mdash;who
took Fannie away. Don&#8217;t you&mdash;understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; and Overton, after a moment, shook hands
with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t want &#8217;Tana to go back on me&mdash;while I lived,&#8221;
he whispered. It was his one reason for keeping silence&mdash;the
dread that she could never talk to him freely, nor
ever clasp his hand again; and Overton promised his
wish should be regarded.</p>
<p>When he went to find &#8217;Tana, Mrs. Huzzard had possession
of her, and the two women were seeing that the
baby got her &#8220;bek-fas,&#8221; and doing some talking at the
same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;And he&#8217;s got his new boat, has he?&#8221; she was saying.
&#8220;Well, now! And it&#8217;s to be a new house next, and a
fine one, he says, if he can only get the right woman to
live in it,&#8221; and she smoothed her hair complacently.
&#8220;He thinks a heap of fine manners in a woman, too;
and right enough, for he&#8217;ll have an elegant home to put
one in and she never to wet her hands in dish-water!
But he is so backward like; but maybe this time&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you must cure him of that,&#8221; laughed the girl.
&#8220;He is a splendid fellow, and I won&#8217;t forgive you if you
don&#8217;t marry him before the summer is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that instant Overton opened the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are ready now to see me&mdash;&#8221; he began, and
she nodded her head and went toward him, her face a
little pale and visibly embarrassed.</p>
<p>Then she turned and went back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_354' name='page_354'></a>354</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come, Toddles,&#8221; she said; &#8220;you come with &#8217;Tana.&#8221;</p>
<p>A faint flush was tingeing the east, and over the water-courses
a silvery mist was spread. She looked out from
the window and then up the mountain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us go out&mdash;up on the bluff,&#8221; she suggested. &#8220;I
have been shut up in houses so long! I want to feel that
the trees are close to me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>He assented in silence and the child, having appeased
its hunger, was disposed to be more gracious, and the
little hands were reached to him while she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Up.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted her to his shoulder, where she laughed down
in high glee at the girl who walked beside in silence.
It was so much easier to plan, while far away from him,
what she would say, than to say it.</p>
<p>But he himself broke the silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You call her Toddles,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;It is not a
pretty name for so pretty a child. Has she no other
one?&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached the bluff above the camp that was
almost a town now. She sat down on a log and wished
she could keep from trembling so.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;she has another one&mdash;a pretty one, I think,&#8221;
she said, at last. &#8220;It is Gracie&mdash;Grace&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked up at him appealingly.</p>
<p>But the emotion in her face made his lips tighten.
He had heard so many revelations of her that morning.
What was this last to be?</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, coldly, &#8220;that is a pretty name, so far
as it goes; but what is the rest of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Overton,&#8221; she said, in a low voice, and his face flushed
scarlet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he asked, harshly, and the little
one, disliking his tone, reached her arms to &#8217;Tana.
&#8220;Whose child is this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not true.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is true,&#8221; she answered, as decidedly as himself.
&#8220;Her mother&mdash;the woman you married&mdash;told me so when
she was dying.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stared at her incredulously.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t believe her even then,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But
how does it come that you&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to claim her, if you don&#8217;t want to,&#8221;
she said, ignoring all his astonishment. &#8220;Her mother
gave her to me. She is mine, unless you claim her. I
don&#8217;t care who her father was&mdash;or her mother, either.
She is a helpless, innocent little child, thrown on the
world&mdash;that is all the certificate of parentage I am
asking for. She shall have what I never had&mdash;a childhood.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked back and forth several times, turning sometimes
to look at the girl, whom the child was patting
on the cheek while she put up her little red mouth every
now and then for kisses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her mother is dead?&#8221; he asked at last, halting and
looking down at her.</p>
<p>She thought his face was very hard and stern, and did
not know it was because he, too, longed to take her in
his arms and ask for kisses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Her mother is dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;I will take the child, if you will let me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said, and tried to smile up at
him. &#8220;You don&#8217;t seem very eager.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you came back here for that?&#8221; he said, slowly,
regarding her. &#8220;&#8217;Tana, what of Max? What of your
school?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I guess I have money enough to have private
teachers out here for the things I don&#8217;t know&mdash;and there
are several of them! And as for Max&mdash;he didn&#8217;t say
much. I saw Mr. Seldon in Chicago and he scolded me
when I told him I was coming back to the woods to
stay&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To stay?&#8221; and he took a step nearer to her. &#8220;&#8217;Tana!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want me to?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I thought
maybe&mdash;after what you said to me in the cabin&mdash;that
day&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better be careful!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t make me
remember that unless&mdash;unless you are willing to tell
me what I told you that day&mdash;unless you are willing to
say that you&mdash;care for me&mdash;that you will be my wife.
God knows I never hoped to say this to you. I have
fought myself into the idea that you belong to Max.
But now that it is said&mdash;answer me!&#8221;</p>
<p>She smiled up at him and kissed the child happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;What shall I say?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;You should know
without words. I told you once I would make coffee
for no man but you. Do you remember? Well, I have
come back to you for that. And see! I don&#8217;t wear
Max&#8217;s ring any longer. Don&#8217;t you understand?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That you have come back to <i>me</i>&mdash;&#8217;Tana!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t eat me! I may not always be a blessing,
so don&#8217;t be too jubilant. I have bad blood in my veins,
but you have had fair warning.&#8221;</p>
<p>He only laughed and drew her to him, and she could
never again say no man had kissed her.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tana!&#8221; said the child, &#8220;&#8217;ook.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span></p>
<p>She looked where the little hand pointed and saw
all the clouds of the east flooded with gold, and higher
up they lay blushing above the far hills.</p>
<p>A new day was creeping over the mountains to banish
shadows from the Kootenai land.</p>

<p>Judy&#8217;s untutored ideas of God, her love of wild things,

<p>The &#8220;lonesome pine&#8221; from which the
story takes its name was a tall tree that
stood in solitary splendor on a mountain
top. The fame of the pine lured a young
engineer through Kentucky to catch the
trail, and when he finally climbed to its
shelter he found not only the pine but the
<i>footprints of a girl</i>. And the girl proved
to be lovely, piquant, and the trail of
these girlish footprints led the young
engineer a madder chase than &#8220;the trail
of the lonesome pine.&#8221;</p>
<p><span style='text-decoration:underline'>THE LITTLE SHEPHERD OF KINGDOM COME</span></p>
<p>Illustrated by F. C. Yohn.</p>
<p>This is a story of Kentucky, in a settlement known as &#8220;Kingdom
Come.&#8221; It is a life rude, semi-barbarous; but natural
and honest, from which often springs the flower of civilization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chad,&#8221; the &#8220;little shepherd&#8221; did not know who he was nor
whence he came&mdash;he had just wandered from door to door since
early childhood, seeking shelter with kindly mountaineers who
gladly fathered and mothered this waif about whom there was
such a mystery&mdash;a charming waif, by the way, who could play
the banjo better that anyone else in the mountains.</p>
<p><span style='text-decoration:underline'>A KNIGHT OF THE CUMBERLAND.</span></p>
<p>Illustrated by F. C. Yohn.</p>
<p>The scenes are laid along the waters of the Cumberland;
the lair of moonshiner and feudsman. The knight is a moonshiner&#8217;s
son, and the heroine a beautiful girl perversely christened
&#8220;The Blight.&#8221; Two impetuous young Southerners&#8217; fall
under the spell of &#8220;The Blight&#8217;s&#8221; charms and she learns what
a large part jealousy and pistols have in the love making of the
mountaineers.</p>
<p>Included in this volume is &#8220;Hell fer-Sartain&#8221; and other
stories, some of Mr. Fox&#8217;s most entertaining Cumberland valley
narratives.</p>
